28 Rthna, 889 Post Mortem. 

Directly following OPERATION: Artery Amputation, Sewer Rats were desiring to further destroy the FMC. With raillines down, their brass was their next biggest hurdle. 

12 Targets were designated, as follows:
- Halifax Lockheed, half of Lockheed-Maughdry, frequent collaborators with FMC in the war industry.
- Halshire Maughdry, half of Lockheed-Maughdry, frequent collaborators with FMC in the war industry.
- Walter Halshire White, CEO of Innovations Incorporated
- Harlon Hanburg, Treasurer of the FMC
- Ryuit Frellor, FMC's Chief Engineer
- dela'Cruxx, Head of the Peace Guard
- Neror Suarez, Head of the Bioparamechanics Wing
- Senator Sprinkly, Senator in the FMC Senate
- Persephone de Rala, Prisoner Processing Head, Head of the Ostrabonia Division
- Friedmont Closteau, born Laos Ghitel, is head of Reesian Native Solution, destroying natives and their environments
- John Everyman, a middle manager of a Kroger's

After a thorough sweep, acting independently, the only survivors were Neror Suarez, Ryuit Frellor, and John Everyman. The FMC as an institute was left effectively hamstrung.
