Karaliah Rickshaw, born 832 PM, is currently the self-appointed Sheriff of Rhodes. She serves as a member of [[The Inheiritors/The Unraveler (Inheritor)\|The Unraveler (Inheritor)]], Designation Kalka-Kylla. In the past, she was an outlaw, working to secure a life for her and her wife Penelope Rickshaw. 

She was born Karali to Etheri and Rytheun, in the Southern Wrathcarved Mountains. She would use her magic abilities and the guided studies under her elders to earn a rank in a band of warriors who left the Wrathcarved to hunt, trade, and communicate. In the end, she would emerge Karali, Witch of the Fourth Azazealean Circle.

Initially, she formed The Maneaters. This was a small gang of exploited sex workers and their associates in colonial Reese. They formed in 864, and through this initiative, she would meet Penelope Rickshaw. She took the name Karaliah to better fit in amongst the new society, and in 866 she would marry Penelope, taking her last name. The brides would continue their work with the Maneaters, breaking the shackles of exploited woman and providing Robin Hood-esque aide to native settlements. 

In 880 PM, with fear of another Offensive, a convoy of Reesian natives and their families organize to travel into the South Wrathcarved Mountains for safety. They are ambushed by FMC, and here the Maneaters cross paths with an [[The Inheiritors/Elqroque d'e Mel\|outlaw]], and, thinking the other is FMC, they duel, until the FMC blows up the convoy. Penelope Rickshaw dies with this destruction. The Maneaters are passed to Portia LaBelle, and Karaliah Rickshaw moves to mourn and hunt the outlaw.

Eventually, Karaliah and the outlaw Elqroque would iron out their issues, being appointed as [[The Inheiritors/The Inheritors (Group)\|Inheritor]] liaisons. In 883 PM, they would elope in the Cacti Planes. In 888 PM, the two split, Karaliah still holding anger at Elqroque for killing her wife, and Elqroque believing Karaliah to be a reincarnation of his wife. They work amicably, but avoid one another.

Now, in the weeks after the Scorching of Rhodes and during the Descent into Burbraic, Karaliah works to reclaim her heritage she lost. She returns to the society in the Southern Wrathcarved Mountains, finding an escaped [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Ghros\|Ghros]]. She takes him hostage, but loses him to a Mystic Strike Team under Oraculaneum Medharthi's command.
