Born in 859 PM, Noel Chupacabra was an Ahn-Lik Thri-Kreen. Raised in the wake of the First Offensive, Noel learned caution around the colonizers, and how to speak just enough in-between the lines to let the other natives be aware of what he is saying without letting the colonizers catch on. 

Him and his family lived on the borders of the First Offensive's claimed land, and his parents were able to build a friendly facade and maintain their families farm. While weaving insults into their empty kindness, the Chupacabra's built up networks for the natives to use and rely on if needed. 

Come 870 PM, Noel was entering his young adulthood. As a stalemate in the Second Offensive was ongoing, there was a severe lull in the Second Offensive. In this lull, tension was brewing in the native networks. The Second Offensive had been going on for 4 years, and many were not in good favor with the new inhabitants of Reese. Those from Charwood were tense, after holding out for two months from persistent FMC attacks. 

Noel took initiative in this situation. Much to the dismay of his parents, he took up a codename that he looks back on and cringes - Thunderbird Man. TBM, which is what everyone would call him, would enter different circles follow the networks to those most interconnected, and recruit them to meet in the abandoned fortress north of Rhodes - Elphons' Keep. As thousands of natives snuck into this castle, he stood in the courtyard, flooded by individuals, ramparts filled with faced, and he spoke. 

TBM's speech would rouse the crowds, and they would hold meetings at Elphons' Keep every 12.5 days. For just over 2 months, they would strike at FMC depots, transports, camps, and such. They salted the earth on FMC-owned fields, and burnt down their storeplaces. Many would outright defend Charwood. Quite a few would steal supplies and ferry it to natives. This was deemed the Farmer's Insurrection, and very few participants were caught. 

This revolution was credited both for why Charwood held out for so long, and why many natives were not taken under the FMC's rule until the Third Offensive.

Sometime, in the coming years, he would meet his wife Anastasia Chupacabra. They lived in the Chupacabra Ranch. In 878 PM, they would give birth to their first and only son [[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|Serendipitous Chupacabra]]. With the birth of his son, his priorities would shift. He had slightly given up on freeing his people after the Farmer's Insurrection and the completion of the Second Offensive. Now, he was determined to free his people and his nation. He had some leads, and thought the best way to start would be the heart of his enemy.

Following his leads in 879 PM, he and [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor, Hand of the FMC]] would discuss employment. Admitting to being the mastermind behind the Farmer's Insurrection, he was hired. As FL-04, Noel Chupacabra was taken into the Freelancer Program. During his pilot run, he was initially planned for precision strikes, but ultimately was opted to be kept as Interrogation General, primarily for his quick-gained expertise in torture. 

In the FMC, he gained knowledge and intel pertaining to their operations. He warned thousands who were in the warpath of the Third Offensive, saving many lives. He continued operations as normal, gaining intel and sending whispers until 871. 

In 881, after the Third Offensive began, many veterans of the Farmer's Insurrection became upset at Noel's lack of action. Eu Spouldi, a Thri-Kreen who spread a racist "Manifest Destiny"-esque manifesto, was killed in retaliation by the disgruntled farmers. In response, the FMC does their most public murders, destroying all of Farming Sector A and killing all inhabitants. This event killed nearly 4 thousand natives, and destroyed large swathes of farmland. 

After witnessing these, and talking Bor into stopping the FMC from destroying all Farming Sectors, Noel would take action. After gathering intel for 3 years, he would take the pseudonym [[The Inheiritors/The Progenitor (Inheritor)\|The Progenitor]], and start [[The Inheiritors/The Inheritors (Group)\|The Inheritors]]. Over 4 years, he would run this clandestine cell operation, striking down the FMC repeatedly.  

In 885 PM, the scheming would come to a head. Noel would go to [[Reese Locations/Duelian\|Duelian]], sneaking through the ongoing war, and descend into Brauk-Her-Ahn. What he did here has been lost to time.

In 886 PM, [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] would scry on his blood, and for some reason dispatch Bor. He would send Bor to dispose of Noel. Bor, on channels accessible to all other Freelancers, would summon him to the [[Reese Locations/Dust District\|Dust District]]. He would have one last drink with [[FMC Operatives/Edvard von Paten\|Edvard von Paten]], telling him about the Inheritors, and depart.

As Noel approached the Dust District with his two rifles, he knew he was walking to his execution. Bor wasn't the endpoint for the FMC - but he was for him. Walking into the District, he prayed this would end with freedom for his people.

He lost dramatically, being destroyed by Bor, who would burn down the Dust District and kill all witnesses of the cruelty. Here, the Freelancer Program would be deactivated, and all who were part of it were warned - with Noel's body as that warning. Afterwards, he would be tortured brutally for 2 months straight. Near the end, he would be inflicted with Reeserot.

In truth, why this came to pass was unknown. von Paten blamed himself, but truly, it seems like whatever happened in the Inverted Spire may have been the root. 

In early 889 PM, Edvard von Paten would break into Inscendia, and would see a large vat labelled FL-04, with tubes and pipes leading in and out. Noel may yet be alive, and may be able to be freed. Only time could tell, but perhaps he didn't suffer for nothing, and perhaps his people may be freed yet....
