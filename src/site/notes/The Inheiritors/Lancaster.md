Part of [[The Inheiritors/The Unraveler (Inheiritor)\|The Unraveler (Inheiritor)]]
Other half of [[Reese Locations/Charwood/Esriel\|Esriel]], made of [[Wytherius\|Wytherius]], his first half, a gruff, untrusting automaton, who would bear the memories of the Drowned King, but he would be unable to access them without a catalyst. 
Lancaster holds a Living Metal centipede that roams throughout him. This is called "Fate's Memory" and if brought together with Time's Muscle in the Horizon Triumvirates secret grotto, the Drowned King could be reformed.
