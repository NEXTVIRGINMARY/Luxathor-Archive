Muffin is a Zhychan, hatched to [[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|Serendipitous Chupacabra]]. She has grown enough to be a mount, and then some - currently the size of one of the evil pickup trucks after witnessing the psychic operation to free the Retainer. She was the last Zhychan, until Serendiptious stole another egg from [[Deities/Daenogoth\|Daenogoth]]'s Inland Empire.
