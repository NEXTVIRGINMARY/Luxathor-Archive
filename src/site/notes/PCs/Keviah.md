Keviah is the lost brother of [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]], who confronted him dramatically at Bor's Funeral. He is currently partnered with [[PCs/Charbok Saullac\|Charbok Saullac]] and [[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|Serendipitous Chupacabra]], working alongside [[The Inheiritors/The Inheiritors (Group)\|The Inheiritors (Group)]].

In mid-889 PM, Keviah would reawaken, the only thing left that he remembered would be Keviah - what he thought to be his name. He awoke with Longclaw - a piece of contaminated Living Metal from [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] to mold it into a Sword-Key. Longclaw has since gone through three iterations.

Keviah currently has a leopard-print suit, pollinator pants, and an osteoculus from killing [[Deities/Daenogoth\|Daenogoth]].
