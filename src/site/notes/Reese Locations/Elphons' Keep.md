Northeast of Rhodes, directly east of Charwood, there sits a lone fort. Sat to bear the future for millennia, Elphons' Keep has only known occupants thrice. At it's heart: The Shrine of Time, an altar to the ancient god of memory Uiy. Not even the Prophesized would have built this shrine, it willed itself on its own, a symbol of one of [[Deities/The Vetus Six\|The Vetus Six]].
- Once, in Progenitorian time, for 3 years [[The Quintessential Pair/The Prophesized\|The Prophesized]] occupied their keep. The Cataclysm evicted them in time.
- Second, in 519 to 522 PM, by local Daer. The Daer no longer exist.
- Finally, in 863 to 866 PM, by FMC before the Second Offensive. The sole survivor of this battalion was [[FMC Operatives/Baron Marques Grildvalke of Duelian\|Baron Marques Grildvalke of Duelian]] 
As a result of Uiy  and it's Shrine, remnants of the dead haunt Elphons' Keep. In a program to try utilizing these spectres, the FMC has once again occupied Elphons' Keep and has been keeping prisoners there and ritualistically killing them. Recently, as of 8 days ago, an Atilan dispatch stayed the night in Elphons' Keep. From the 23 who were living when they first entered, only 7 left.

This project is the W//W (Wraith//Weapon) Project, led by Neror Suarez. W//W, as instructed by [Thyra Will](Tytheradt), is where all prisoners on Reese are funneled. They are killed in terrible ways, and through the Uiy shrine, it is believed their manifestations could be weaponized.
