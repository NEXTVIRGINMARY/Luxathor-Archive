The Mnemonic Abyss is a tear in Vatria, hidden just a few hundred meters below the seabed. After the Martyrdom Syzygy, the destruction of the Othohan Scar and the Uncharted Regions coalesced in a volatile collection of energy. This deposit sunk into the ocean, and continued to the direct opposite side of Vatria, where it erupted into the Mnemonic Abyss. 

Following this eruption, the Abyss would lay undiscovered for centuries, until it was unearthed by Oma Twain in 865 PM. She found the region known as the Temporal Bubble, the underbelly of a mountain that was opened by the Abyss, and the highest and most accessible part. The Temporal Bubble, unlike other parts of the Abyss, is flooded in shadow.

In 867 PM, Twain and d'e Mel successfully bridge the gap over the Bubble. On the opposite side, Twain sets up a camp as she studies the fauna spawned by the Abyss, feeling a calling to it. After 2 years, a Pterocaligo emerges, and submerges her in the Abyss. She is the only known individual to survive submersion. When she crawls to shore, her veins bleed shadow, and she cries black, brackish waters. 

With her emergence, so too the Mortal Forge appears, in 869 PM. It may only be reached by passing through the Temporal Bubble. 

After 7 years of being haunted by the Abyss and studying, she perfects the Mortal Forge. She meets Elqroque in Rhodes, and begs and pleads for some reason to stay, guised in layers of conversation. Their conversation ends sour, and Oma Twain sees no reason to stay. In 876 PM, Oma Twain creates herself anew in the Mortal Forge. She is now Drěndïr, a porcelain imitation of a humanoid, adorned with gold. Shadows dance behind its eyes.

Drěndïr now serves the Mortal Forge for eternity, and acts as a liaison to the Mnemonic Abyss.
