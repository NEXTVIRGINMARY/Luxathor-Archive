The Luxathor Archive is a large library originally built in one of the Uncharted Region countries. At this point, it is unknown whether the Archive or the nation was called Luxathor. [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] sequestered it away during the Matyrdom Syzygy retroactively, saving the knowledge. He stashed it in [[Atilus/Cicero\|Cicero]]'s mind.

The Luxathor Archive is ran by a beholder bound to the archives called Qkhaou.
