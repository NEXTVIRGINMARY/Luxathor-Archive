Al-A-Xel is a refugee colony from [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Isles\|The Exellian Isles]], and declares themselves their own sovereign. Their countries full name is Al-A-C'uhr-Dien-Syf-Nu'muhcr-Xel, translating to The Newfreed of the Savior of the Savior Xel, Foreverborn. The Capitol City is Al-A-Xel, translating Xel, Foreverborn.

The cities government is run by the Concord. The Concord is a collective of 654 people from all the districts of Al-A-Xel. With proportional representation from each district, it is first come, first serve per meeting. The Concord is ran by Dolomir Hxn'Hxrt (pronounced Hin Kurt).

Some high ranking members of Al-A-Xel are Constable Lro, a large amalgamation of ooze who runs the prison (rock off the Iszollarum Crag and Skriven Port), and Mindmaster Unni, a large crab woman who has a vast understanding of the mindscape)

The prison is called The Depths of Lro. There is a small domed pavilion that has an elevator downwards. This elevator leads to a large cave, lined completely with ooze. Inside the ooze sit the prisoners, unable to breathe, move, or escape. Lro's body makes up the entire prison. Lro, himself, sits in the small tower in the Skriven Port. 

**Districts**
- Solil District
	- The Solil District is outside Gate Xel. It consists of a couple fields used once every 4 years for harvests, and predominantly necropolii. There are small tombs for various families outside the gate. Those closer to the gate are typically more influential families with larger tombs. Even those in the Trosan District are afforded sepulchers.
- Gate Xel
	- Gate Xel is the main wall that cuts off the peninsula from the rest of Reese. Named after the towns namesake, the wall is guarded by Elisyana, the Warmages that protect the town. The wall is made of limestone erected from the ground without any influence but magic and the earth. It stretched about 90ft tall.
- Osrendii District
- Trovacki District
- Trosan District
- Zaljev Threshold
	- The narrow crossing between the Osrendii and Prostranost District. On either sides, large walls are erected, only 30 feet tall here. In between, the land here is considered unruled. When someone is to be removed from Al-A-Xel or to receieve a large prison sentence, tradition allows them 39 hours set up to sell whatever they can, unregulated. If this allows them escape, so be it, and they will be judged as such by a council of high ranking officials if they return. If they do not do enough to escape, their sentence is carried out, and are stripped of any Alaxellan possessions.
- Prostranost District
- Radnik Cliffs
- Keviahn Impasse
	- The Keviahn Impasse was an old fortification that was found upon their landing. A surprisingly intact dam, the first landers stepped onto it. During an attack by the Apostate Sept, a group of less secretive, more flash and awe [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]] and predecessors to the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Engram Assassins\|The Engram Assassins]], this wall withstood much magic artillery, and was named the Keviahn Impasse, in honor of the one who broke away.
- Izsollarum Crag
- Skriven Ports
- Izsdasan Ports
