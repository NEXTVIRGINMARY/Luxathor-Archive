Project Delphi is the codename for [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]]'s plan to eradicate life of Reese and invert his phylactery. No one is high enough to view the details of this plan, however Neror Suarez, Harlon Hanburg, Danier Golwig, Persephone de Rala, Friedmont Closteun, and Bor are all aware that this project only involves Thyra Wesson.

Dorian Mournecoth had found traces of Project Delphi's goal, and warned of it in his last will and testament. Dir Ean Lang may just be one of many enabling the long chain of events that will ruin the FMC.

As PROJECT::FMC and PROJECT::CROWN  specified in their onset, HVT-001 is to ultimately enact [[Project Delphi\|PROJECT DELPHI]]. ((0000000)) 

If: "((0000000))" occurs;
then, initiate "((XXXXXXX))"" closure.

<Cancelation Reason> The FMC has served it's purpose. Thank you for your service.

Prior to DELPHI INITIATION, ensure ULTIMATUM PROTOCOL is active. Eradication of DESIGNATION::ALVITA is vital for success of ((0000000)). 

Prior to DELPHI INITIATION, ensure ((XXXXXXX)) ongoing. ((0000000)) operates under RELIANCY CONTINGENT. For convenience of HVT-001, ongoing efforts for ALVITA SILENCE is welcome.

Prior to DELPHI INTIATION, ensure REUNION AFFECT has been completed.

DELPHI ONSET will ascend HVT-001 from //Designation: Tyrant to TYRANT ASCENDED. HVT-001 should utilize ELUISINIAN ONSET to begin PHALANX ROUTE, and reach STRONGHOLD::HEART. Within the aforementioned stronghold, recall HVT-002, and begin ELUISINIAN PROTOCOL. 

Once ELUISINIAN PROTOCOL is in effect, begin INVERSION::PHYLACTERY. HVT-002 and surviving FMC Infantry should operate under HEARTHSTONE PHALANX. After INVERSION INCUBATION period is complete, PROJECT::CROWN will be complete.

In the process of INVERSION::PHYLACTERY, expect the following:
- Geochronal Seismic Activity around the Stronghold, some spilling outward [ONSET:1 DAY]
- Vitality Restructuring to TYRANT ASCENSCION; primarily from Fauna, partial flora [ONSET: 3 DAYS]
- Chromatic Warping [ONSET: 6 DAYS]
- Intrinsic Poisoning [ONSET: 9 DAYS]
- Restructuring of Reese//Blank Slate [ONSET: 15 DAYS]
- Fledgling Phylactery Manifestation [ONSET: 25 DAYS]
- INVERSION::COMPLETE [ONSET: 39th NIGHT]

Following the finalization of PROJECT::FMC and PROJECT::CROWN, begin FINALE SEQUENCE and END::FMC. HVT-001 has ascended past the need for the FMC, and all remainders should be neutralized. If HVT-002 has survived to this point, HVT-001 should entrap it in TOMB::REESE.

After TYRANT ASCENSION and INITIATION INCUBATION are both completed, 
|| Timestate henceforth to be referred to as PINNACLE PHENOMENON||
HVT-001 will have control of Reese, and can totally enact his will within. Furthermore, any death will be immediately undone.



IMPORTANT - HVT-000 should be secured beforehand. He cannot be recovered after. INVERSION INCUBATION begins.
