Missive from Ryuit Frellor, dated 20 Uphyxos 888. Addressed from Ryuit Frellor to Halshire Maughdry, Halifax Lockheed; duplicate submitted to H. Hanburg for archival purposes. Text as follows:

Ryuit Frellor, addressing a missive to Directors of Lockheed-Maughdry corporation:

Good day to you both. In my best judgement I believe you both have heard of me. It is my pleasure to make your acquaintance, even through pen and paper. 

I recently have been at the blade of baseless accusations from your competitor. I have sent the following:

::SEE: R.F.C.12.2.A:: 
::CICERONE AMENDMENT - SEE R.F.A.2 FOR CONTEXT::

I believe it is in your interests to outdo your competitors. Both financially and in every technical facet. I wish to cooperate with your company on the MOAB, and on alternative deployments of the MADM and MAWP. 

You both know what accomplishments are attached to my name. They speak for themselves. They speak volumes more knowing I was the sole mastermind behind them. Respond to this address.

Gods be with you.
