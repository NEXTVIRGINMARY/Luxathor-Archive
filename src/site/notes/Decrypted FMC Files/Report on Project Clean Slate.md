Report on Project Clean Slate

Blackstone Clearance Only. Any violating witnesses to be removed - contact dela'Cruxx for operation.

Project Lead Frellor Report: It is with my utmost privilege to urge Project Clean Slate to be deemed a failure in it's current state. My team and I have developed a pure Radium thermonuclear device, varying from 100,000 to 500,000 kilotons. After much work, we perfected the designs and took one of 150,000 kilotons into the sea. 

Following data from Mystic Expeditionary Force 11, we detonated 50 klicks west by 50 klicks south. I was on site, alongside 3 other heads in this project. We were stunned in its deployment. This weapon will not be safe for domestic deployment. 6 devices were moved into storage underneath Duelian, as per the orders of F. Closteau. Transportation was carried out over the course of 3 nights as to maintain the secrecy of this project. Devices are as follows:

- 2x 100,000 kt 
- 250,000 kt 
- 350,000 kt 
- 450,000 kt
- 500,000 kt

Director Wesson, if you will, I request a shift of perspective for Project Clean Slate. I would like 700,000 more gold invested in this project, as we will begin to explore the possibility of the following payloads:

- Radium Carbide
- Radium Oxide
- Radium Chloride
- Radium Ammonide

Thank you.
