Final Internal Report on STELLOR OVERRIDE Initiative, as written by Ryuit Frellor. Dated 887. Addressed directly to Thyra Wesson, for use internally. Remains accessible from archive per request to H. Hanburg. Text as follows:

Project Lead Ryuit Frellor, summation of STELLAR OVERRIDE Initiative:

As of 887, STELLAR OVERRIDE succeeds with finalization of the Frellor Mechanized Mobile Armor and Weapons (henceforth referred to as MAWP) device.

Specifications are as follows. Production guidelines may be found at any FORTISSIMO-GRADE Production Plant in Reese, or in file R.F.A.5.99.0, or M.W.1.15.

BUDGET:
Per MAWP: 482.222 STANDARD GOLD UNITS
STELLAR OVERRIDE Init.: 295.000.000 SGU Initial;
- Breakdown: 280.000.000 SGU Initial Budget, 5.000.000 SGU per following year.

WEIGHT:
MAWP - Unarmored, Unarmed - 36,000 lbs
MAWP - Armored, Unarmed: 80,000 lbs
MAWP - Armored, Fully Armed: 96,000 lbs
Priscillium Liquid-Crystal Insert: 1.67781 lbs

STELLAR OVERRIDE STATISTICS:
Prototypes: 4 Produced, 3 Dismantled. 
Test Production - Prototype 4: 120 MAWPs. 
- 119 Fully Rolled Out, 1 Preserved for exigent circumstance.

ARMOR:
CLASS A "LATIERRE": 79% Steel alloy, 14.9% Talamore, 5% FMC Proprietary Blend, 1.1% Ionized Radium. Standard Issue, Heat Index 3, BFT Index 4, RAD Index 2, Arcane Index 1. Suggested for most use cases.

CLASS B "ULIUM": 60% Steel alloy, 30% Talamore, 5% FMC Proprietary Blend, 2.5% Radium, 2.5% Ionized Radium. Issued per Pilot Request. Heat Index 4, BFT Index 3, RAD Index 2, Arcane Index 3. Suggested for CQC special ops, Arcanoalerts.

CLASS C "Oroso": 50% Steel alloy, 25% Talamore 21% FMC Proprietary Blend, 4% Ionized Radium. Issued per Pilot Request. Heat Index 3, BFT Index 3, RAD Index 2, Arcane Index 2. Suggested on a case-by-case basis.

CLASS D "DIORNO" - 50% Steel alloy, 40% Talamore, 10% Isolated Volatile Radium. Issued by Environs condition. Heat Index 4, BFT Index 2, RAD Index 4, Arcane Index 3. Suggested in a fallout scenario. Not for use in a volatile position.

CLASS E "SUBITIS" - 65% Steel alloy, 23% Talamore, 9% Volatile Stasis Radium, 3% FMC Proprietary Mix. Issued upon Defense Condition 2, all MAWPs expected to don it. Heat Index 4, BFT Index 4, RAD Index 3, Arcane Index 4. All Pilots expected to undergo 3 weeks quarantine for every 4 days equipped. Not for free use. 

Weapons:
HV-1.1 Proprietary Flame Projector: Equipped via left or right shoulder pauldron, inner. Cycles fuel to reduce accidental deployment or overheated, est. 13 seconds per full cycle. Fuel: Acetylene napalm mix, 55/45. Standard deployment sweeps twice within 15 feet, 65 degree. 

Elley-Wewn Electromagnetic Projector: Equipped within left or right trap installation. Refills debris via subsurface intake system, replenishing as needed. Projectile deploys at 2.254.11 meters per second, uptime for 2.356 seconds. Avoid firing at high value FMC infantry. 

RPG-000 Intelligent Array: Equipped in scapula plating. Refills done via external injection. 10 seconds per projectile reload. Maximum capacity is 60 projectiles. Rocket propelled grenade fires in configuration from Pilot, each projectile must have a firing mode submitted. Modes: vocal command, ocular command, heat seeking. 

Uotreit B.E.A.C.O.N.: Equipped within left or right trap installation, opposite EMP. Refill via internal pools. Maximum capacity is 15 projectiles loaded, 750 internal pool. Each round is a .224 caliber B.E.A.C.O.N. round. Tracing capabilities highlight target struck internally. Projectile leaves slight visual trace externally.

SPEED: 2.85 mph

LIABILITY: 
Priscillium LQI: The Priscillium Liquid Crystal Insert is the only present liability. It's volatile nature, critical importance, and brittle structure leave it extremely vulnerable, however it must remain in that position due to the better ability to ventilate and channel energy. Included in the MAWP is a auxiliary battery holding 1.25 days worth of low running power in the event of a catastrophic attack.
