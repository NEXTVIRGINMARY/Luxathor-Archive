::CIRCULAR CONFERENCE TABLE, 5 SEATED, ONE STANDING. VOICES OVERLAPPING::

::ENTER: HVT-001||Apparition:Director::

HVT-002//Designation: Echo: *Silence!*

::ROOM QUITES::

HVT-001//Designation: Tyrant: *Thank you my* HVT-002. *And thank you all for coming on such short notice. If you haven't heard by now,* HVT-003//Designation: Facade *was murdered in* ENVIRONS::MOONCRASH. *Perpetrators are Inheritor-aligned. As follows:* HVT-297, HVT-601, *and* HVT-676 *are declared as the responsible party in this matter. Furthermore* HVT-003 *took drastic measures in a last ditch effort to neutralize this party - henceforth to be referred to as* CARRION VIVUS *- and is unable to be salvaged from beyond the grave. Finally,* ENVIRONS::MOONCRASH *has been lost. We should be prepared to destroy it when I give the word, but otherwise remain away.*

HVT-147//Designation: Banker: *Sorry to interrupt,* HVT-001, *but I wish not to waste time on irrelevant details and ornamental phrases. These 'hellions'... who is to say they won't come for us..?*

::TABLE BREAKS OUT IN MUTTERING SUPPORT, BEGINS TO SETTLE AFTER HVT-211 BEGINS TO GATHER HIMSELF::

HVT-211//Designation: Surgeon: HVT-147 *is right. Why should we wait? They're right there. Isn't there intel regarding the Inheritors having a presence there? Two for one. I'd much rather an operation immediately and try to ambush them in grandiose display.

::EVEN STRONGER POSITIVE SENTIMENTS DISPLAYED::

HVT-002: *Silence!*

HVT-001: *Yes, thank you my* HVT-002. *Be not afraid. They are powerless in the grander scheme of-*

HVT-098//Designation: Warden: *Apologies, sir, but don't be daft. You know what they're capable of. Inheritor-aligned and having done so much already... They could be very dangerous.*

::BRIEF PAUSE, AIR IS TENSE::

HVT-098: *And, sir... You're holding out on something.*

::TENSER, LONGER PAUSE::

HVT-306//Designation: Eraser: *Yes, I agree. Their threat could be too great. I don't wish to bring ruin on the FMC, but...* (whispers:) *Revolution...*

:TABLE BREAKS OUT IN ARGUMENT AND WORRY.

HVT-002: *Silence!*

HVT-001: (Sternly, like iron:) *They are nothing. Be. Not. Afraid. This will not happen.*

HVT-098: *Sir. What are you hiding.*

::TENSION. ALL LOOK TO HVT-001::

HVT-001: *With* HVT-003*s* *death, it has come to my attention that* HVT-676//Designation: Bellwether *and* HVT-000//Designation: Crown Jewel *are in fact one in the same.*

::COLLECTIVE GROANS::

HVT-001: *This means nothing! I can raise him if needed. For the time, I wish to forge my own bonds.*

HVT-308//Designation: Rising: *Who are you to say it means nothing? He killed* HVT-003. *I want vengeance.*

HVT-306//Designation: Eraser: *I agree. Your own investment in some terrorists should play no part in national stability. Don't throw it all aw-*

::HVT-306 BEGINS BLEEDING FROM EYES AND MOUTH::

::ENDS::

HVT-001: *You will not speak to me in that manner. Forget this fact. I thought you all were elites among our ranks. Do not make me rethink our ranks.*

::PALPABLE WORRY IN ROOM::

HVT-001: *So. Next topic. What is our next course of action?*

HVT-308: *Where is my place? My mentor was murdered and I'm denied retribution.*

HVT-002: *Calm. You will be under me. Retribution will come. Trust that.*

HVT-147: *I will be playing financial sabotage against them. That sounds joyful. Other than that, you can find me in my high tower.*

HVT-306: *I have some plans regarding the war under Duelian.*

HVT-098: HVT-211 *and I are working hard on Project W//W.*

HVT-001: *You all hold secrets. I smell it. No matter. We will continue our war on the Inheritors. Take the pamphlets. Operation Rapture is on the horizon. We can discuss that in time. I'm sure you're all just itching to leave. We meet in a week.*
