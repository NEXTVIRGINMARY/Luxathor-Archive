If by circumstance or by necessity, HVT-000//Designation: Crown Jewel is to die, begin [[Decrypted FMC Files/Operation Snowfall\|Operation Snowfall]]. ((0087959))

If: "((0087959))" occurs;
then, "((0000000))" failure.
then, "(XXXXXXX)" failure.

*<Cancelation Reason> It has all failed. Thank you for what you gave, regardless.

{{Before SNOWFALL INITIATION, SNOWFALL must occur. In doing so, prepare for the worst. Nothing will seem logical, but carry out "((0087959))" to it's completion.}}

SNOWFALL INITIATION will result in ELUISINIAN ACTIVATION. HVT-001 should utilize ELUISINIAN ONSET to warp the climates of ENVIRONS::VATRIA. Resulting effects should equate to PROJECT DELPHI, but worldwide.

SNOWFALL INITIATION and it's effects will complete ALTERNATE: ALVITA SILENCE. In this world,
||Timestate henceforth to be referred to as SILENCE::VATRIA||
most should be routed. Begin INVERSION::PHYLACTERY. Convert STRONGHOLD::HEART into a TOWER//SANCTUM, and pivot into SNOWFALL SAVIOR.

In cases of SURVIVORS//INTRUDERS, manifest and silence. STRONGHOLD::REESE//SELF is not to be breached. 


REVISION: Escort HVT-297//Designation: Genome and HVT-601//Designation: Ambassador to find HVT-111//Designaton: Divine. HVT-111 should remain near the ruins of ENVIRONS::MOONCRASH. Escort HVT-297 and HVT-601, and begin PROTOCOL GODFALL. Afterwards, ensure safe ascension to DEMIGOD::WYTHERIA.

Aforementioned action should align interests and complete an amicable memorial to HVT-000, as well as giving a chance for HVT-000A and HVT-000B to rise via HVT-001 and DEMIGOD::WYTHERIA.
