A letter from Thyra Will, as part of Thyra Wesson's collection. Date unknown, never posted. Addressed from Thyra Will to Kira Westbrook.

Missive reads as follows:

Kira, darling:

I'm so, so sorry. It needed to end. I've finished all I needed. You... 

It all would've been too much. Enneline. She would've been beautiful. You would've been the greatest mother. If only I could've been her father. Your... Your pure being. Everything about you. With a touch of my magic. Our girl would've been wonderful.

She's in a good place. I made arrangements for her. She will amount to everything we are and more. My brother is coming back. The one I told you about. I wish you could meet him. Perhaps you can. Once I have a phylactery to invert - there's no telling what I could do.

When you're both there, I'll introduce you. I'm sure you'll adore each other. He is almost as luminescent as you.

Goodbye, for now.
