Missive from Ryuit Frellor, dated 20 Uphyxos 888. Addressed from Ryuit Frellor to Lang Aal Mour; duplicate submitted to H. Hanburg for archival purposes. Text as follows:

Ryuit Frellor, responding to your previous address:

Good day, Madame Lang Aal Mour. I hope this is not too much a step in the wrong direction for our professional relationship, however your previous address caught me off-guard. So, let me be clear:

By no means is the weapon in my namesake - the Frellor Mech. MAWP (Mechanized Mobile Armor and Weapons Platform) - a liability. Insinuating otherwise is quite a bold attack on not only my own character and expertise, but that of the FMC as a whole.

The MAWP, as I shall henceforth refer to it as, was built entirely to my own research and specifications. All other engineers involved in it's development were entirely subordinate to my instruction. The only outside influence in its inception was the statistics of ammunition weight. 

The aforementioned circumstance was present in the creation of the MADM, and will be upheld for the creation of the MOAB.

I will personally schedule a meeting with you to introduce you to all of it's idiosyncrasies and innovations - all made in my own design.

If you wish to divest from our weaponry - do so. Do no more of this mockery. Your financial decisions are ultimately your own, but let me sway yourself for but a moment: I am the sole creator of these instruments. I am the deliverer of it's immaculate conception. If you doubt me: consider yourself no better than those it would be used against.

I have no more to say to you.
