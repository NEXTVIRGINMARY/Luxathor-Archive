Missive from Ryuit Frellor, dated 10 Deismo 889. Addressed from Ryuit Frellor to Harlon Hanburg, Friedmont Closteau, and Thyra Wesson. Text as follows:

Project Lead Frellor Response, in regards to Project Clean Slate.

Director, I implore you to consider the consequences of a pure Radium device. The radiation. The arcanofallout. The pure, unadulterated destruction. If detonation in the Inverted Spire is one such path we wish to take, Duelian will fall with it. Our trains will be completely set off course. Our own military will be in ruins.

Consider.

I mean no disrespect. Thank you.
