**PROGENITORIAN TIME: -** 
- **The Progenitor** and **The Unraveler** exist without creation, they just are.
- The Progenitor weaves tapestries of worlds, and The Unraveler sows chaos in these tapestries
- The Unraveler is trapped in **Exellia (Dimension)**, opening a window for The Progenitor to create Vatria, in which it introduces **The Prophesized**
- The Unraveler piggybacks into Vatria, and creates **The Primordials**

**CATACLYENE ERA** - 
- **The Cataclysm** occurs, warping time. This event is scaled to 1 year, but ultimately is as unknowable and unscalable as Progenitorian Time.
- The Prophesized create the Godsbane Artefacts in an attempt to stop the Cataclysm

**-7051 Post Mortem**
- Atilus is established on its peninsula

**-700 Post Mortem**
- A Nameless King begins his rule over a Nameless Kingdom in Auril. He lifts a poverty stricken woman named Irina to stand with him, and she becomes a prophet of his, spreading his name.

- A Nameless King dies, yet his name and his kingdom prospers

**31 Post Mortem**
- **Early Auros** In the first year of his second term as Emperor, Lucan Thon'sahd dies, reason cited as "Sudden Collapse and Death"
	- In reality, Nienwald and Herria have been plotting this death for a while, and now believe they have the civilians believing the Eladrin are savages, and that Lucan was one of the good ones, and he was a proud Aeotalist.
- **63 Uphyxos:** "The Flaring Terror"
	-  - On the final day of Uphyxos, the remnant of the free Eladrin tribes launch an attack on Lucan Thon'sahd's Funeral. As the solar flares rage, painting the sky a terrible scarlet, Eladrin tap into a wild magic that is catalyzed by these flares. 91 Royal Families, who served in the equivalent of a parliament, are all slaughtered, leaving 10 families behind. (Herria, Nienwald, and 8 others.) After slaughtering thousands of people, in their final acts, they ignite Lucan's corpse and plunge him into The Wound. The free Eladrin tribes are then put through a genocidal campaign.
- **1 Rthna**: Wytherium Engine begins, The Eladrin Address
	- The Exellian Isles finalize the Wytherium Engine in the wake of the strongest flares of Uphyxos yet, and their current heirarchy strengthens. This engine allows for direct Communion with Wytherius.
	- Kyynren Herria delivers "The Eladrin Address" - a speech dedicated to the 1,436 who died in The Flaring Terror. He announces the 91 Royal Families who were killed, and begins the current political system, with The 9 Houses, and the Emperor. He also directly addresses any surviving freemen Eladrin, where he says that they are now public enemies of the state and the church, as the attack that spat on Lucan's memory and hurt the whole people of the nation. He forbids them from leaving, and they are to register themselves and their property. and in secret sets the military on establishing a perimeter that will close and will eradicate the escaping Eladrin.

**37 Post Mortem**
- 63 Uphyxos: The Eladrin Euology
	- Herria delivers "The Eladrin Eulogy" in which he declares that after a long national effort, they can once again sleep peacefully. The Eladrin have been completely wiped out of the nation, and the surrogate rings of Eladrin in the elite families have all legal restrictions removed, leading to widescale horrors against Eladrin, that are still ongoing and hidden. Eladrin blood transfusions run rampant.

**41 Post Mortem**
- Grylle Marchar, an astronomist and researcher who is patroned by the Dahlic, discovers Crescens

**43 Post Mortem**
- A large sector of military and serfs under the Dahlic family remnants who survived The Flaring Terror begin colonization of Crescens. Nearly a quarter of Zenithene population leaves.

**241 Post Mortem**
- First signs of the Astral Axiom begin to emerge, as the power the cosmos has is undeniable. 

**333 Post Mortem**
- **3 Calluo**: The Martyrdom Syzygy 
	- A Universe-wide syzygy occurs, in which every star and planet aligns, warping the tapestry of Vatria into an ouroboros. The Mystics extend themselves to a foreign nation for the first time on **14 Auros** in anticipation of this event. The Exellian Mystics and The Astral Axiom ally. The Axiom promises to channel as much of the power of the stars to the Isles as possible, so long as the Mystics can properly teach them how to wield magic and not just use it in their foci. 
		- Auril is safeguarded by Wytherius
			- Wytherius uses his powers of godhood to shield all of Auril and his Apostle' Ridge from the syzygy, completely diverting the stream around himself. His body becomes terribly scarred.
		- The Isles are safeguarded by Wytherius in the Engine
			- By extension, Wytherius safeguarding Auril also protects the Exellian Isles against his will. It is with the Syzygy that the engine ascends from a machine of worship and communion, to containing a fragment of Wytherius, as the ritual occurs centered on the Engine, while communing. 
		- Atilus is safeguarded after Baipa offers 5 sacrifices to the Mystics.
			- Baipa offers 5 serpentfolk to the Mystics as an exchange for Atilus' preservation. His son Hebi witnesses this, but Baipa is careful that no one else may ever know. Hebi, on the other hand, takes this as a precedent.
		- Herria is safeguarded by The Wound, and the Progenitor inside.
			- The death of the Progenitor caused the syzygy, and thus the energies dispelled by its death that caused this will not wrap back around. Part of Herria is destroyed, but for the most part is is safe.
		- Crescens is mostly safeguarded by the Last Queen Victolia Dahlic offering her unborn child - The Divine Heir - to the syzygy, so he may fully link with the Progenitor.
			- Believed that at one point, their heir will become the next Progenitor, the Dahlics ruled as a Divine Monarchy. Last Queen Victolia Dahlic was especially devoted to this belief. As the syzygy happened, she slit both her wrists and her throat. She offered her unborn son, and in return her skin was burnt into a luminescent eggshell white, with craters and cracks like a moon. Her eyes softly glowed, and absorbed other light. Cracks in her skin from damage also glow a soft blue. She does not eat, drink, sleep, or blink, she just is. She will live pregnant until the 63rd of Uphyxos. Normally, the solar flares light up the sky during this month, the last day especially. The whole month of Uphyxos bore no solar flares though, as she would shine brighter instead. At midnight on the 63rd of Uphyxos and 1st of Rthna, Victolia would disappear. She birthed a baby, but disappeared. The baby wasn't dead, but it also wasn't alive. This baby is still suspended deep in Crescens, waiting. The Regency Crown then took over. 
		- Othohan, at this point, is a scar between planes. Dragons and other mythical creatures roam here, but the Boiling Sea and the Coiled Clouds keep them contained. It is not safeguarded.
		- Reese is safeguarded through time by Tytheradt in 889 Post Mortem.
			- In 889 Post Mortem, as the Well of the Font surges with energy, Tytheradt uses his Wytherium Engine to channel this surging energy right back into Reese. This energy is so strong that since it is there now, it has always been there. He is successful, and Reese remains untouched as 50 years worth of bottlenecked energy sustains Reese through the syzygy's energy.
		- The Uncharted Expanse currently holds 3 kingdoms rivaling the size of Crescens and Atilus. They are not safeguarded.
			- The Luxathor Archive is salvaged and implanted into the mind of the Retainer
	- The Astral Axiom would only protect themselves, and allowed the rest of the Uncharted Expanse to be destroyed. At this point, the other powers would've begun exploring but that all was lost. They have stayed out since. The Axiom used the syzygy to lift many pieces of land into the air, and they currently use this land to fly around and hide themselves.
