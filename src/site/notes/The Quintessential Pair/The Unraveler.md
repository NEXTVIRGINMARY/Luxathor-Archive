The Unraveler is one of the Quintessential Pair. It cannot be understood without its pair. It is the opposite of [[The Quintessential Pair/The Progenitor\|The Progenitor]], and was trapped in [[The Quintessential Pair/Exellia (Dimension)\|Exellia (Dimension)]]. These circumstances allowed for Vatria's creation, including the Cataclysm.
