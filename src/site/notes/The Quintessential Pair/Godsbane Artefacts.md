A set of 3 relics, currently possessed by [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Engram Assassins\|The Engram Assassins]]. These relics are ancient weapons, preserved from the Catacleyne Era. When the Prophesized began falling to the Cataclysm, they forged weapons to kill the Quintessential Dyad ([[The Quintessential Pair/The Progenitor\|The Progenitor]] and [[The Quintessential Pair/The Unraveler\|The Unraveler]]). These would be three artefacts: Ephemirene Focusing Lens, The Metaphysical Tether, and the Soulknife Liaison. 

The Ephemirene Focusing Lens would concentrate the being who was its target unto this plane. It would have no means of existence outside of the then and now.

The Primor Metaphysical Tether would take all these reflections of the being, and force them into tangentiality. They would be real and here: now and forever.

The Soulknife Liaison would use the gifts of the other two, and deliver a strike so profound and infinite, it would kill immortality. The target would be no more mortal than anyone else.

When used in conjunction in that order, the artefacts are capable of producing mortality in any victim - even gods with the strongest line of tithes.
