The Progenitor is one of the Quintessential Pair. It cannot be understood without its pair. It is the opposite of [[The Quintessential Pair/The Unraveler\|The Unraveler]], and formed [[The Quintessential Pair/Exellia (Dimension)\|Exellia (Dimension)]] as a trap for it. These circumstances allowed for Vatria to come to creation.
