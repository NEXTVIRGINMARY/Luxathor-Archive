The Hated Chosen are those who undergo a pact with [[Deities/Divinities/Daenogoth's Lie\|Daenogoth's Lie]]. In exchange for powers, they give him an eye and are given an Osteooculus. Daenogoth ultimately uses the Hated Chosen to gain power and attempt to find an Ephialtes.

When someone becomes a Hated Chosen, they are marked when acting according to Daenogoth's interests. When fully marked, Daenogoth may bring them to Burbraic to ascend them.

At any point, Daenogoth may choose to forgo a Hated Chosen. He will deploy Aspects to attack them, and force them to do terrible things until they lose themselves and become an Implement.

An Implement is a Hated Chosen who has become corrupted, and now serve Daenogoth mindlessly.

Current Known Hated Chosen:

[[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|Serendipitous Chupacabra]]: Serendipitous, a hero sweeping the Oasis of Reese, underwent a pact with Daenogoth, and is quite promising for ascension. 

Jesse Montezuma: A pirate, and former von Paten Brigadier, who fell out of love after the Arro-Machki incident. Has been a Hated Chosen for years, but isn't even half marked. Runs the Amygdalan Church, farming power for Daenogoth through peaceful means. Killed by Serendipitous Chupacabra

Athox Bourdain: A lowly kid who fell into a deal with Daenogoth without his full judgement. Became fully marked, and then tried to break out. Daenogoth forcefully ascended him into an Ephialtes Impending, a heightened Implement.
