Quest Type: Rescue
Place(s): Ostrobonia Compound
Character(s): Cicero

Cicero has continued decrypting the abundance of FMC files that were in his manor, on top of those which were recovered on the Night of Black Knives and the Rhodes Militia's operations. One report that was making its way to the top was a report that Thyra Will's Daughter was obtained by de Rala's Ostrobonia Division. Whatever reason Tytheradt's daughter is being held against his knowledge is in the air. She is believed to be held somewhere on Reese. Cicero can point you in her general direction.
