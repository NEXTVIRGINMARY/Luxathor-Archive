Shelton Kilroy had information on the Scorching of Rhodes - that much is certain. He says Serendipitous told him and ordered him not to say anything, but no one buys it. The Lelki pointed Serendipitous to the Charwood Keep when trying to find the "Serendipitous"

After following Kilroy's lead, they found the "Breathing Room" - a chamber with a set of documents detailing sabotage done to the relationships of the Sewer Rats, a necklace with a serpent charm, and an order for an range of materials. Whatever is in command of the Breathing Room clearly has some sort of agenda against you. Put an end to it early, or wait for it to come to light and snuff it out then.
