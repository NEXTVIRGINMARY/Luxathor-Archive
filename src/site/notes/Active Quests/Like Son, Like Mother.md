Place(s): Reese, ???
Character(s): Anastasia Chupacabra, Kahn-Eir, ???

Anastasia Chupacabra… changed… when Noel Chupacabra "died." She would leave for days at a time, becoming distant towards her only son. 2 years ago, when Serendipitous would leave his ranch, bidding farewell to Mr Dryston and his family's livestock, he would never see his mother again. Or so he thought…

Across the Heroes' journey through Reese, they have found traces of her. Seven Fushigi Orbs, placed around the continent, all finding their way to her son. When they all were gathered, they arranged in a pattern to lead Serendipitous to Fa. She spoke to the council, and made sure Serendipitous would have the grace follow the path of his father. And much more recently, sometime after the shootout but before the planting of Muffin, she was here, placing an apology and a small gift to her son.

What drives the Gunslinger's Mother to her enigmatic agenda, and where has it taken her?
