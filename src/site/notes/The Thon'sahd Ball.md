[[The Thon'sahd Ball\|The Thon'sahd Ball]] is what is known as the Conception of the FMC in the public eye. Taking place in 99 Rthna 846 PM, this is where [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] presented the value the FMC would produce through Bor and the Retainer. This was also the first instance of the name "Reese" being used for the desert continent in history. 

After Tytheradt became afflicted with Reeserot, he came to understand how much harder the combing of Reese would be alone. He could not find his brother without some support. It was from this decision he would recover an artifact and establish relations with [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor, Hand of the FMC]].

After an extensive meeting at Site XI with Bor and [[Atilus/Cicero\|Cicero]], the plan was made. Through utilizing the artifact as an engine for a flying airship, Bor and The Retainer would present the findings of Thyra Wesson, who was too ill to make it. They would bargain for investments for Wesson's company: The Frontier Mining Company. The FMC would unearth more of this resource - Radium - and would distribute it 

The FMC would accumulate over 80 million gold from various investors in Herria and Crescens, and from the Thon'sahd Ball, begin their warpath that now threatens so many.

Despite not showing publicly, Tytheradt watched the entire event from a one-way window on the highest, most secure floor of the Eladric Palace, also called the Lucan Thon'sahd Manor, directing The Retainer as much as possible. During the Investment Auction block, the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Engram Assassins\|The Engram Assassins]] would strike. 49 figures, swathed in shadow, would spring on Tytheradt. Unaware of his 'relationship' with The Retainer, they would attempt to destroy Tytheradt before he gained capital and power.

Tytheradt, in complete silence, would annihilate his would-be killers. As they cried out and shouted devastating magicks in the soundproofed room, Tytheradt would dance around them, brutally dispatching the assassins one-by-one. With their death, a new age of the world would be marked: The Age of the FMC.
