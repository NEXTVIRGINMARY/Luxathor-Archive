Orrous Morton is a tortle, born to the Morton family in the year 858 PM. He has lived his whole life in [[Reese Locations/Rhodes\|Rhodes]], assisting the family apothecary, and helping to transition it into a general story when his mother died to Reeserot. This period wouldn't last long though, as he would contact Reeserot in 869 PM - when he was barely more than a hatchling.

Tortles are particularly vulnerable to Reeserot, a curse from their immortality. While they cannot die due to age, they can die to other causes, and Reeserot only emerged 6 or 7 generations ago.

After his infection, his father Doctor Morton would quarantine him to their house above the shop. He was to be held there until he was cured.

For 20 years, Orrous would wait.

About 3 years in, Orrous fell Comatose.

In 889 PM, with the arrival of [[The Sewer Rats\|The Sewer Rats]], Doctor Morton would acquire the final ingredient for his cure. He immediately began brewing his cure. When administered, his son would awaken. Mutated and changed, yes, but cured.

Quietly, Orrous held a secret. During his time comatose, he was not alone. He was with [[The Grey Mistress\|The Whisper Within]]. She was guiding him, whispering truths and revelations and secrets. She showed him what he would be capable of. And in 17 years he awoke.

And She did not stop. 

Now, mutated by Rot and awoken yet again, Orrous discovers the Whisper was not lying. Her truths and revelations and secrets were all true. Additionally, he finds he can touch the Weave, and draw out arcane power through Rot. Hesitant to tell his father the full extent, he simply mentioned he "wanted to hone his magical attunement." And then, he would depart on an expedition. 

This journey was a farce.

He would contract Reeserot once again, purposefully.

Once obtained, he would return home. In Reese, he would begin working on striking a balance between the Rot and himself. He yearned to find a way to ensure his form wouldn't decompose, and he could still wield the Rot.

And the the Scorching occurred.

He fought hard alongside [[The Inheiritors/The Inheiritors (Group)\|The Heroes]] and their allies, but it wasn't enough. The town was heavily damaged, and so was he. His father would find him unconscious, hiding in an alleyway, and would quickly drag him home, enraged.

Once Orrous awoke, the years unspoken blew up on them. The Doctor believes Orrous was putting himself and the town at risk. Tortles are practically immortal, but have a terribly weak immune system, and he had contracted the Rot not once but twice now. The only reason he is still alive is because of all the time and money the Doctor spent caring for Orrous, and the miracle that the others brought what he needed. Not only that, but if Reeserot spreads through Rhodes, then the Inheritors will have to choose where to pool funding, and these people will die after all the stress they've gone through.

Orrous believed his Father would never let his Son become This. He was right. So, Orrous took matters into his own hands. He assured his father that Rhodes would be safe. Of this, he was sure.

Then, not too long after, Orrous feels someone he is distantly connected to die. The Sewer Rats have slaughtered Auphreite, and the Whisper Within cries out. She tells him he must "Go Up," and she would tell him the truth.

Orrous would "go up," and in The Above, would commune with [[The Grey Mistress\|The Grey Mistress]]. She and him would discuss, and he would become the Conduit of Rot, but would agree to hold out on pouring out Rot, but he would make it up.

Orrous returns to Rhodes, changed, and tells his father he needs to "touch the sky." Orrous then leaves. In hysterics, Doctor Morton breaks down.

Orrous would do some research, and then begin walking to the Bloodied Flatlands. Here, he would pour out Rot, and then use his abilities to mold the infected ground into the Solbound Spire. He would intend to commune with the Mistress physically, and allow Her to pour out the Rot, without need for a Conduit. Then, once all were infected, he would alter its symptoms, and make them Perfect.
