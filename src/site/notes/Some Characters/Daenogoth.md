Daenogoth is a 5-armed demon that is currently bound to the Burbraic Theater. He is also referred to as "The One True Scream," "Misophobia,"  "Too Sharp I Cannot Dream," and "Amygdala."

In 785 PM, Sil-Ahn awas heading to Burbraic Theater to watch a children's school play centering around Sil-Ahn. Many of the town is there, as the largest school was putting on the production, and Sil-Ahn came in body.

At the height of the play, Sil-Ahn was attacked by a cult to an imagined Devil. Sil-Ahn would try to cast a protection spell over the Theater to protect the civilians. The civilians would be forced back, and Sil-Ahn would be stuck inside, dying.

Sil-Ahn would succumb 1,111 days after this.

After killing Sil-Ahn in body, the spell would be dropped, and the High Guard of Burbraic would close in on the cult, charging them with Treason, Terrorism, Homicide, Deicide, Public Endangerment, and more, executing them in the Theater without trial. There, the theater would remain untouched, as a memorial to Sil-Ahn. The murderers corpses would rot there. The runes of Sil-Ahn's blood would remain.

Mid-787 Post Mortem, the Burbraic's hatred towards the cult would swell. That year, the harvest would be the lowest ever, due to consistently overcast days. Burbraic would mourn their God of Light, and the hatred would funnel in. The hatred fueled an abstraction, giving it form, and he would take the name Daenogoth. At this stage, he was a minor demon.

In 787, Burbraic would notice the rise of Daenogoth, and would try to combat it, but it would kill every soldier sent into the Theater. Daenogoth would then try to leave, to slaughter more, and find itself bound into the Theater by Sil-Ahn's immortal blood. Enraged, Daenogoth would begin manifesting. Over the next 9 days, no villager would sleep, as they were tormented by this demon. On the 9th day, a group would steal the holy artifacts from Sil-Ahn's days, and rush in. Daenogoth would slay all of them, and in their wake, Daenogoth would emerge, leveling Burbraic. 

Daenogoth remains in Burbraic Theater, trapped by Sil-Ahn's immortal blood. Interlopers pass through, and it offers a bargain. In exchange for seeing through their eyes, he will give them access to some magic. The ossified eye it bestows upon them is really a seed for the plants of its soul, and upon their death, their skull will bloom. At the moment, Daenogoth is content using his vessels to gaze upon the land and inflict terror that way, and feels that Burbraic Theater is a safe enough place. If his name is said 3 times, he will summon whoever to his Inland Empire. His throne is the very moment the blast that leveled Burbraic went out, and the city began crumbling.

[[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|Serendipitous Chupacabra]] has taken his pact, and in a moment of pressure, took a mark.

His favorite sin is blossoming civilization.

When marked, if his Hated Chosen die before being fully marked, they blossom into the *Flacielia rigorium*, a plant grown in Daenogoth's hateful magic. Serendipitous possesses one such artifact.

Once fully marked, upon their death they will be consumed by Daenogoth, harbored as energy for hatred to feed him. Their bodies will grow slight *Flacielia rigorium*, and their husks will be used fully by Daenogoth, who will puppet them to farm more power. Alternatively, he will take a fully marked one to his great objective.

His goal is to harbor a Hated Chosen who will break the runes that Sil-Ahn's blood holds him by, and unleash him. Here, the Hated Chosen will ascend to The Ephialtes, and they will rule as supremely powerful individuals.
