Bor was born somewhere in Reese, to two parents. Neither are very descript, as neither are things particularly of interest to Bor. He was delivered in 746 PM, and was unlike his parents - he was a centaur. His mother died in childbirth as a result, and his father would keep Bor alive until about 750 PM, at which point Bor was left for dead in the forest.

His childhood was a constant battle. Between moving around Reese to endure heatwaves, animal attacks, bandit parties, and food scarcity and scavenging for food and water, he was constantly chasing survival. Around his teens, he would establish a borough in the thickets of the Charwood Forests, near the Wrathcarved.

He would learn a lot in this childhood, his ruthlessness and cruel nature being highlights. From his late teens until 843 PM, he was a hunter and muscle-for-hire. To those who would hire him, he would build a friendly facade, establishing rapport amongst Reesians. Those who crossed him would quickly discover his sadistic, inhumane nature, and would not live to tell the tale. 

Come 843 PM, Bor would encounter someone who truly understood him. [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] would land in Reese, and their paths would cross. Tytheradt would explain his plan and his need for a physical enforcement proxy, and would gift Bor advanced weaponry. In this man, Bor saw the rest of his life.

In 846, Bor would go to Herria with Tytheradt and [[Atilus/Cicero\|Cicero]]. At [[The Thon'sahd Ball\|The Thon'sahd Ball]], Bor would meet many elites and through his polite persona, would assist in securing the FMC's future.

Over the next decades, Bor would be involved in the FMC-sponsored conquest over Reese. Within the Offensives, he would wear a heavy steel mask on his face, leather armor adorned with the bones of natives on his horse side, and plate armor with a painted red hand sigil on his chest. His weapon during this time was a semi-automatic rifle with a shotgun under-barrel component named Brenhilder, something as close to his mother's name that he could find. After the completion of the Second Offensive, Bor would transition to securing the land gained in the FMC's offensive.

In the wake of the war, the land was rife with those opposed to the FMC. And God help anyone who crossed the FMC while Bor was around. He settled back into his habits of establishing rapport with the general population, and being a terrifying force to his enemies. The Hand of the FMC was a menace upon the sandy plains of Reese.

While he was the law, Bor would bring about the Freelancer program. By hiring those too dangerous to be civilians, but hiding their employment, the FMC could gain a monopoly on terror, and easily gain an upperhand on the Empire and the Crown. 

The program worked wonders. Things like the FMC-backed von Paten Brigade, run by [[FMC Operatives/Edvard von Paten\|Edvard von Paten]] took down massive military transports, and people like [[The Inheiritors/Noel Chupacabra\|FL-04]] could break government officials into spilling out information like nothing.

Eventually, Bor received a direct order from Tytheradt. While communication wasn't totally uncommon, strict orders were quite the rarity. Tytheradt told Bor that Noel Chupacabra had become far, far too dangerous. He began [[The Inheiritors/The Inheritors (Group)\|an insurgency network]] , and it had to be pared before it grew, and it must be made an example of. So Bor took him into the [[Reese Locations/Dust District\|Dust District]], and ruined him while the area went aflame. In the fight, Bor found his gun began shattering strangely, as if it was being telekinetically crushed, so he took Noel's twin guns and combined them beneath [[Reese Locations/Rhodes\|Rhodes]].

This order was truly issued due to Noel's choosing by the [[Deities/Empyreans/Lelki Coagulate\|Lelki Coagulate]]. Tytheradt feared it, and had to stomp it out before it became an issue. 

In these years, Bor was happy. He felt like he actually had a father: Tytheradt was like him but more. More sadistic and dangerous. More potent in his friendly, loved facade. More ambitious in his hunt for power. However, this joy came to a screeching halt upon the arrival of the heroes.

He enjoyed toying with them, however, they became far too potent too fast, and Bor needed to dispose of them before Tytheradt would give him an order again. Bor planted the idea that [[Atilus/Hebi\|Hebi]] was going to be hanged in Reese when the heroes were absent, hoping it would reach them quick enough to bait them. It worked - and Bor died days later. 

In his death, Bor suffered. He had undergone a failed, unholy ritual in a desperate attempt not to fail Tytheradt and himself. But he had died, and there was no coming back. Tytheradt would use multitudes of power to reach beyond the veil, and speak with Bor. Here, he would question him. He had gave Bor a suggestion when the party began accumulating power, and he was seeking its answer.

From death, Bor gained consciousness for but a moment, and heard Tytheradt's voice. The man who he considered his father had reached out to him for some final words. He could rest. All Tytheradt asked was:

"What was [[PCs/Keviah\|the Reborn's]] name?"

Bor answered eagerly. And it was quiet yet again. There was more opportunity for them to talk, but... it was quiet. And Bor was dead.

It wasn't until his funeral that most people learned Bor was engaged with the FMC. To the few that survived since his early days, through the Offensives, this was heartbreaking - the centaur who was so kind had been ravaging their land. To most, this just meant he was helping keep them safe.

The influence of the Hand is still felt, many, many days after his demise. Without him dead, the FMC would never fall. And perhaps his assortment of machinations has backfired, opening exploits for those who seek them. Perhaps his loyalty and devotion to the FMC's cause will be critical to its downfall.
