Dorian Mournecoth, born Dir Ean Lang, was a drow native to the Wrathcarved in Reese. Sometime during his late teens, his brother Wou Ief Lang disappeared without a trace. Dorian joined the FMC during the First Offensive to try to find his brother. Initially, this was meant to be a short enrollment until Wou Ief's fate was found, but Dorian got too caught up in it all, and is in too deep.

After the First Offensive, Dorian would be promoted to the rank of Blood Guard, as per standard. He chose to stay in Rhodes to join the FMC Brass. He rose the ranks, becoming the Head Overseer of the mining town, until the crash. Afterwards, when FMC thinned its rule on the city, he would be in a higher up secretarial position, still bowing down to [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor]] and some [[FMC Operatives/Notable FMC Figures\|Notable FMC Figures]]. 

He gave up on his brother, after some time. In spite of his more relax position, he decided: he wanted to be a part of it, no matter what "it" was.

After the FMC break-in, Bor threatened to send him into servitude for his missteps. Dorian did not want this, and fought Bor. It was a landslide in Bor's favor. Bor then took him to Inscendia for disciplinary action. Spending about 10 hours here, it was quite the unpleasant experience for Dorian. On his way out to being redeployed to Subterranean Depot II:L.13, to finish Bor's pet project on *The Only Law*, he found "A Heart of the Traitorous God" and has been inspecting it since. After 4 days or so in his redeployment, and infiltration occurs, with only 2 days before the project is complete. 

He would die in these attacks.

The Heart he smuggled was crucial in FMC tests, and even moreso to the God it belonged to. His death landed it in the hands of the party, who would place it into [[Deities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]]' grasp. Perhaps Dir Ean Lang will be one of the crucial elements in the chain of events that destroys that which took him and his brother from this world, and free his nation.
