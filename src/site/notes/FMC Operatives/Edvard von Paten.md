Edvard von Paten is a human male born in 843 Postmortem, currently aged 46 years, hailing from the Zenithene Empire. The von Paten family was, previously, a member of the Nine. That was until 781 Postmortem, when Edvard's father Richtofen von Paten was ousted. Eagan Bruesz abused knowledge of his gambling addiction to steal his demarcation, and get their way into the Nine, dishonoring his father's lifelong effort to overthrow the Bruesz family from the Nine.

Using what influence his family had left, he was among the first of the Colonial Wave to step foot onto Reese. He came in shortly after the First Offensive, in the year 862. Getting in early, he bought a tavern in Rhodes, and appointed Kolt, a goblin with life-debt to him, to run the bar.

He was scouted for the FMC, and his placements spelled good fortune for him. He joined the Mystic Expeditionary Force, a branch of the FMC, who seek to establish contact and a foothold on the Exellian Isles - the home of the shadowy mystics. During MEF Mission 13, something went horribly wrong and he was found nearly lifeless in a comet's crater in the middle of Reese. He came back horribly scarred by burning on both his forearms, but both operated perfectly fine. The scarring had formed a crust of burnt flesh and stone, and underneath flowed some sort of slowly moving glowing energy. He wears gloves to hide his first gift, but his second acts more of a mantle of his power: the Hellfire Apostle.

After this incident, he was relieved from the MEF, but kept as an Freelancer for the FMC. During this time, he lived as an outlaw, the head of the von Paten Brigades, and would alternate between lucrative robberies, and dangerous political missions. After an incident about 3 years ago, Eddie ceased his brigade, and pivoted to being a loan shark, with massive interest rates.

This change would happen after [[The Inheiritors/Noel Chupacabra\|Noel Chupacabra]] would tell him about a [[The Inheiritors/The Inheiritors (Group)\|clandestine insurgency network]] he was building over drinks.  Somehow, [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor, Hand of the FMC]] caught wind of the happening, and started to torture Noel, before parading his ruined body, recently plagued with Reeserot, to all the Freelancers.

This set them all straight.

About 3 months ago, he caught wind that Bor was going around killing former Freelancers. He commissioned a train, meant to carry him to New King's Bounty. This train was meant as a trap for [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor, Hand of the FMC]], but would instead catch Keviah, Serendipitous, and Charbok. This train: *The Fool's Folly*, would be moving from Duelian to New King's Bounty. He intended to kill [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor, Hand of the FMC]], and then flee to Crescens, and then go to Old King's College, and then from there he was planning to go to the Uncharted Territories, and then join the Astral Axiom.

After capturing the 3, he would be nearly killed by them, but [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor, Hand of the FMC]] would finish the job. Right before they came to confront him, Kolt would propose a plan in which he escapes with von Paten's soul contract - what he stole from the FMC 3 months ago - so that von Paten could be free. Kolt then said he would confront Eddie's killers and ask them to revive him.

They would revive him, and give him the opportunity for the freedom he has always wanted. He would bestow his Brigadiers unto them, and through Kolt, would move to Old King's College to visit Head Librarian Stens, who would have a Celestial Focus, that von Paten seeked in order to join the Astral Axiom.

As of Bor's death, he has linked with the Astral Axiom.
