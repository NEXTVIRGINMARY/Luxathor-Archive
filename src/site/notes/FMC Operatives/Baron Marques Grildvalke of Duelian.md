Marques Grildvalke is the brother of standing Empress Aphelia Morne, of House Grildvalke and the husband of Donatello Ossaen-Grildvalke. 

In the 840s, the Grildvalkes were newcomers in the advertising industry, but quickly rose to riches. Hailed as the "Propaganda Monarchs" by the elite of the Zenithene Empire, they would launch a campaign against the Julian House, resulting in them getting a spot in the Nine. 

In 850, when he was 10, Hagren and Methya would adopt their first son, Marques. He was raised and loved by them, but they did not fully consider him their son. In 856, Aphelia Morne Grildvalke was borne, and Hagren would meet with Marques, making it clear that Marques was not going to be considered for election to the Imperial Academy come 860. 

That year would be his last living in The Apex. In 860, he would leave for Reese, joining the First Offensive as an Infantryman. His Company would be the ones to establish Lateria for the Empire, and he would bring his company to New King's Bounty, and establish that too.

During this Offensive, he returns home for the funeral of his partner [[FMC Operatives/Donatello Ossaen-Grildvalke\|Donatello Ossaen-Grildvalke]]. Here, he meets Bor, and is given many commendations for his performance, including his signature sword: Earthmover.

Come 866, Marques kickstarts the Second Offensive as one of Bor's underlings. He would fight here until his sister was decared Empress.

In 875, he would go home and celebrate with his sister, who would resurrect Donatello as one of her first acts as Empress. The Second Offensive would end one week after his departure. 

In 880, Marques would rally support for a Third Offensive. Backed with texts of Eu Spouldi, he rallied large support claiming everything to Duelian.
