On the Third of Calluo, 333 Postmortem, the universe would align after the Cataclysm, tearing Vatria apart. The Martyrdom Syzygy was a universal syzygy, aligning every star, every planet, every Empyrean, warping the tapestry of Vatria into an ouroboros. All denizens of the world would reach for their place to survive. This event is what truly gave [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]] their standing.

The Mystics extend themselves to a foreign nation for the first time on **14 Auros** in anticipation of this event. The Exellian Mystics and The Astral Axiom ally. The Axiom promises to channel as much of the power of the stars to the Isles as possible, so long as the Mystics can properly teach them how to wield magic and not just use it in their foci. 

 Auril is safeguarded by [[Deities/Divinities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]]
	- Wytherius uses his powers of godhood to shield all of Auril and his Apostle' Ridge from the syzygy, completely diverting the stream around himself. His body becomes terribly scarred.
  The Isles are safeguarded by Wytherius in the Engine
	- By extension, Wytherius safeguarding Auril also protects the Exellian Isles against his will. It is with the Syzygy that the engine ascends from a machine of worship and communion, to containing a fragment of Wytherius, as the ritual occurs centered on the Engine, while communing. 
 Atilus is safeguarded after Baipa offers 5 sacrifices to the Mystics.
	Baipa offers 5 serpentfolk to the Mystics as an exchange for Atilus' preservation. His son [[Atilus/Hebi\|Hebi]] witnesses this, but Baipa is careful that no one else may ever know. Hebi, on the other hand, takes this as a precedent.
- Herria is safeguarded by The Wound, and the Progenitor inside.
	- The death of the Progenitor caused the syzygy, and thus the energies dispelled by its death that caused this will not wrap back around. Part of Herria is destroyed, but for the most part is is safe.
Crescens is mostly safeguarded by the Last Queen Victolia Dahlic offering her unborn child - The Divine Heir - to the syzygy, so he may fully link with the Progenitor.
	Believing that at one point, their heir will become the next Progenitor, the Dahlics ruled as a Divine Monarchy. Last Queen Victolia Dahlic was especially devoted to this belief. As the syzygy happened, she slit both her wrists and her throat. She offered her unborn son, and in return her skin was burnt into a luminescent eggshell white, with craters and cracks like a moon. Her eyes softly glowed, and absorbed other light. Cracks in her skin from damage also glow a soft blue. She does not eat, drink, sleep, or blink, she just is. She will live pregnant until the 63rd of Uphyxos. Normally, the solar flares light up the sky during this month, the last day especially. The whole month of Uphyxos bore no solar flares though, as she would shine brighter instead. At midnight on the 63rd of Uphyxos and 1st of Rthna, Victolia would disappear. She birthed a baby, but disappeared. The baby wasn't dead, but it also wasn't alive. This baby is still suspended deep in Crescens, waiting. The Regency Crown then took over. 
Othohan, at this point, is a scar between planes. Dragons and other mythical creatures roam here, but the Boiling Sea and the Coiled Clouds keep them contained. It is not safeguarded.
	Othohan, a land of luscious greens and fantasy creatures, is hit with the syzygy. The tear between planes is ripped so large that it disappears, completely destroying the other side. The land of Othohan is scarred, as it becomes a volcanic hellscape. The Boiling Sea and the Coiled Clouds are destroyed.
Reese is safeguarded through time by a future power.

The Uncharted Expanse currently holds 3 kingdoms rivaling the size of Crescens and Atilus. They are not safeguarded. All three fall. 

 The Mystics would conduct their operations during this decade as according to the Ghroshan Hypothesis - a theory put up by Reinhath [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Ghros\|Ghros]]. This would spell out their ascension, as follows: 
 
 During the Syzygy, 5 Serpentfolk - the best suited species for magic conduction, as believed by the Mystics - were brought to the Isles, and blindfolded around the Wytherium Engine. As the energy blasted, their plan went into action. Simultaneously: 
 1. The Keviah projected himself and the 5 sacrifices into the astral plane; 
 2. The surrounding Oraculaneum channeled their magic into a powerful tree, that would force life magic into the surrounding people; 
 3. The Reinhaths cast Power Word Kill on the sacrifices; 
 4. The Syzygy hit the the astral plane and Vatria simultaneously.
 These 4 things happening all at once killed the Keviah, and channeled his soul into the 5, who would all die but be restored immediately. Their astral projections would be hit by the syzygy but wouldn't die, instead be restored to their bodies which had died twice in that split second. These 5 would then be paralyzed in stone, and the energy of the syzygy their bodies and spirits absorbed is still being sapped for use to this day.

The Astral Axiom would only protect themselves, and allowed the rest of the Uncharted Expanse to be destroyed. At this point, the other powers would've begun exploring but that all was lost. They have stayed out since. The Axiom used the syzygy to lift many pieces of land into the air, and they currently use this land to fly around and hide themselves.
