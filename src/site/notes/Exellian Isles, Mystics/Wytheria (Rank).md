A new rank for [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]] to rule [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Isles\|The Exellian Isles]]. This rank was devised by [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Engram Assassins\|The Engram Assassins]], and approved by the standing [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Keviah (Rank)\|Keviah (Rank)]]. The Wytheria rank is meant to make [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Wytherium Engine\|Wytherium Engine]] obsolete, by having those who kill [[Deities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]] come in and rule in place of it. Instead of the Engine and the Keviah to commune and share its will, the highest power will be the Wytheria.

The Mystics speculate that Wytherius' power is so vast, that if he is killed directly by someone's hand it will erupt and be absorbed by those nearby. This is the crux of the Wytheria idea: if Wytherius is killed, the killers will become as Wytherius.

After they have Wytheria, the plan is to have them tear open the Wytherius Engine, leaving a rift that will link them. Then, communally, they will inspect time and direct the Mystics as they please. The Keviah rank will be destroyed, and the Oraculaneum will be set on defending and preserving the Wytheria.
