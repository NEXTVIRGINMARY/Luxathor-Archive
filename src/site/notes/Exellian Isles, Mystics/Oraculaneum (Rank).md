The Oraculaneum is the highest rank of the Mystics, only under the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Keviah (Rank)\|Keviah (Rank)]]. Consisting of a tight circle, the Oraculaneum would commune and make nominations for what the Keviah would be used for, and what actions to take based on their decrees. Beneath them, the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Reinhath (Rank)\|Reinhath (Rank)]] serves. Despite there only being one rank between them, there are centuries of experience separating a potential Oraculaneum from a Reinhath.
