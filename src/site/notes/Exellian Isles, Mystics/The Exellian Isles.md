The Exellian Isles is the name of an archipelago, named after [[The Quintessential Pair/Exellia (Dimension)\|Exellia (Dimension)]], the prison of the Unraveler. It was called this due to their affinity with magic, which is at a much higher rate than outsiders. Their magical touch, and repeated rejection from outside societies, caused them to identify with Exellia. 

Perhaps it was always meant to be, or perhaps it was a self fulfilling prophecy, but there exist heavy supernatural defenses around the islands, and even a barrier to scatter invaders beneath the Silver Sea. For example, [[FMC Operatives/Edvard von Paten\|Edvard von Paten]] was scattered to an arena of hellfire when he was a part of the MEF. 

Only those with powerful magic can pass this veil, hence why [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]] are so cut off, and why they are the only ones able to venture in and out consistently.
