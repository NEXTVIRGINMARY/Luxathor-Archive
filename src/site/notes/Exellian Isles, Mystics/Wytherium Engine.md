A powerful creation that focuses a [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Keviah (Rank)\|Keviah (Rank)]] into the timestreams to be guided by [[Deities/Divinities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]]. There are 3 known of in Vatria - one housed at the heart of [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Isles\|The Exellian Isles]], a makeshift one on Reese that was forged by [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] and held in [[Reese Locations/The Obsidian Aeroes\|The Obsidian Aeroes]], and a prototype abandoned by [[Deities/Divinities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]] stashed away in Renlyamore Manor.

This engine of interface was conceived by [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]]. Originally an object of worship, with their ritual during the Martyrdom Syzygy, it granted them direct connection to Wytherius. 

The Engine is a construct similar to one of those biblically accurate angels. It is a bronze contraption of 3 intertwined rings around a centralized point. The outermost ring is inlaid with eyes of myriad races. The second ring has hundreds of lips, singing some song with no voice. The third ring is eyes whose irises have been ripped to occupy the full eye. All of them look to be in extreme pain. On each ring, there are spots to hold some sort of crystal. If you were to trace a line from them, they would make an X pattern. All of the slots on the Renlyamore Manor's Engine are empty. In the middle, there is a tear in reality; simultaneously twisting inward and forcing outward. In Renlyamore, this tear is a faint glowing echo.
