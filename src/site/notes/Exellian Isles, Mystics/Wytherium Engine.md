A powerful creation that focuses a [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Keviah (Rank)\|Keviah (Rank)]] into the timestreams to be guided by [[Deities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]]
One is housed on [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Isles\|The Exellian Isles]]
Conceived by [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]]
There is one makeshift one on Reese forged by Tytheradt; and a prototype Wytherius made, that is stashed in Renlyamore Manor. 

The Engine is a construct similar to one of those biblically accurate angels. It is a bronze contraption of 3 intertwined rings around a centralized point. The outermost ring is inlaid with eyes of myriad races. The second ring has hundreds of lips, singing some song with no voice. The third ring is eyes whose irises have been ripped to occupy the full eye. All of them look to be in extreme pain. On each ring, there are spots to hold some sort of crystal. If you were to trace a line from them, they would make an X pattern. All of the slots on the Renlyamore Manor's Engine are empty. In the middle, there is a tear in reality; simultaneously twisting inward and forcing outward. In Renlyamore, this tear is a faint glowing echo.
