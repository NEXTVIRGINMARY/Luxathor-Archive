A rank of Oracle.

Highest honor in [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]]'s culture. Chosen by the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Oraculaneum (Rank)\|Oraculaneum (Rank)]], and is then fed into [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Wytherium Engine\|Wytherium Engine]] to commune with Wytherius to plan the moves of the Mystics. 
[[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] was deemed the Blessed Keviah, until the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Accursed Keviah\|Accursed Keviah]] had unrooted him from the Wytherium Engine, and was banished unto the fabric of reality, the only tangible memory he has was the word "Keviah," a mockery from the Oraculaneums.
