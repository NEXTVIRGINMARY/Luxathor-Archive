Ghros was the father to Xel, the one who radicalized [[PCs/Keviah\|Apprentis-Xel]]. Ghros was one of the most decorated beings in history. As an Oraculaneum of [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]], he would lead them in a number of bold, yet successful operations. 

He would start his career in the early 300s, as a Reinhath. As the cosmos would bend, he would propose the Ghroshan Hypothesis. In summation, the Mystics would need to secure their standing in the world by heightening the Engine, and their own power in turn. They would need to turn their sporadic appearances into more than that. They must be intervening in a way to establish their reputation and tear down others.

As praxis to his dogma, he would design a model to be used. This would be the action taken during the [[The Martyrdom Syzygy\|Syzygy]]. Ghros would meet with Baipa, going through the motions to take the hostages, then guiding the ritual. 

He would be promoted to High Oraculaneum, a rank only reached by 3 individuals. 

He would live, leading the Mystics alongside the other Oraculaneum and Keviah, until he would grow old and retire himself in the Hall of the Keviah. Before this, however, he smelt misdeed. He would lead a sect of powerful mystics to the shore of a small island, finding a Cabin by the Sea. They would plunder it, killing the parents, and [[PCs/Keviah\|scattering]] and [[Tytheradt\|stealing]] the two children. 

Not too long after his retirement, he would be reanimated to curb the Accursed Keviah's revolution. They would unmake Keviah, and at Ghros' behest, they would brand his soul with that name. 

Once that was handled, Ghros would stay in service for some time to help stabilize the Exellian Isles, once again turning himself into a statue when he was done. 

The Mystics would reanimate him quite often for advice, to Ghros' quiet displeasure. As they set their sights on Reese, they would reanimate him and use him. He has been quite upset recently, but unable to act on it....

You know what they say. The enemy of my enemy...
