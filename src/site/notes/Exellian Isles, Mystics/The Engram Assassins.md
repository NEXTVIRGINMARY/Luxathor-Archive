A group of designated assassins, formed by the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/The Exellian Mystics\|The Exellian Mystics]] in 841 PM. Built off the insurgent group "The Apostate Sept," they were formed by the [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Keviah (Rank)\|Keviah (Rank)]] after [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] was detected to be active and alive, and was building the FMC. Their goal was to kill him, however, at the Thon'sahd Ball in 846 PM, they were crushed. 

In 886 PM, the Engram Assassins were reformed from Mystics who were in training for the past 40 years. After extensive research, they have learned that the FMC operates mostly through a bootlegged [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Wytherium Engine\|Wytherium Engine]]. The Engram Assassins main target switched to [[Deities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]], despite the fact their own society ran on the Wytherium Engine.

The Mystics believed after killing Wytherius his soul would fracture into his murderers. Those would then be promoted to a new rank: [[Exellian Isles, Mystics/Wytheria (Rank)\|Wytheria (Rank)]]. They would rule eternally, and the Keviah would be their liaison with the rest of the Isles - The Engine deprecated. 

In 889 PM, the Mystics would have their Reinhath die at the hands of new individuals, unrelated from the FMC, and an Oraculaneum vouching for them. After some observation, the Engram Assassins will move in, and their acting leader ==**Borlon**==, would offer them Godsbane Artefacts and the rank of Wytheriah if they kill Wytherius and proceed onward to kill Tytheradt. 

These relics are ancient weapons, preserved from the Catacleyne Era. When the Prophesized began falling to the Cataclysm, they forged weapons to kill the Quintessential Dyad. These would be three artefacts: Ephemirene Focusing Lens, The Metaphysical Tether, and the Soulknife Liaison. 

The Ephemirene Focusing Lens would concentrate the being who was its target unto this plane. It would have no means of existence outside of the then and now.

The Primor Metaphysical Tether would take all these reflections of the being, and force them into tangentiality. They would be real and here: now and forever.

The Soulknife Liaison would use the gifts of the other two, and deliver a strike so profound and infinite, it would kill immortality. The target would be no more mortal than anyone else.

When used in conjunction in that order, the artefacts are capable of producing mortality in any victim - even gods with the strongest line of tithes.
