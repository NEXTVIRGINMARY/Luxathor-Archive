Masas-Dima is an Ahn-Kiin, born Huri-Ort in 871 PM, in Chau-El, Brauk-Her-Ahn. He lived a fair life, about as expected for a Thri-Kreen in the FMC-Occupied Reese. While living a meager life, it was about as good as one could hope. As an albino Thri-Kreen, he was forced to avoid the surface as much as he could. However, he'd still sit in the tunnels of Brauk-Her-Ahn as much as he could, as near to the surface without touching the sunlight. He'd do this so much he would break off and make an abode in the walls up there. 

Once the Third Offensive hit, he was attacked by [[FMC Operatives/Baron Marques Grildvalke of Duelian\|Baron Marques Grildvalke of Duelian]], and retreated. His home was destroyed in the building of [[Reese Locations/Duelian\|Duelian]] - both personally and warped into the Inverted Spire. Huri-Ort begin his descent to Fa while injured, hoping to commune with the Lelki Coagulate before he was to die.

Huri-Ort would come to Fa terribly injured. Here, he would find another. This Thri-Kreens name was only known to Huri-Ort. They both gazed upon the Lifeblood together, when Huri-Ort would choose his own survival over brotherhood. He forced the head of his comrade into the Lelki, which consumed his life, and left his body a husk filled with energy from the Coagulate.

Huri-Ort would then feast upon the corpse, eating the chitin, the flesh, the bones - all of it. The Lelki would retaliate by cursing him. Huri-Ort would be inflicted with vampirism, and would become ravenous. He would feast on people who ventured in, and would take the name Masas-Dima - Eater of Life. 

Masas-Dima would use this vampirism well. He would begin to grow his brood, the Faan-Rac (the Deathborn Brood,) which now occupies Fa. Masas-Dima is using Fa and the Lelki to grow his brood and psionically infuse the Vampiric Thri-Kreen. Once he feels confident enough, he is going to take the Lelki into himself, and elevate his brood.
