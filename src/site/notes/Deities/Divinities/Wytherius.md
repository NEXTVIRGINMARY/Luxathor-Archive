God of Water, Fate, and Time. Fate and Time in the way that water will erode whatever it rushes against.

His Alias is [[Deities/Divinities/The Drowned King\|The Drowned King]]

Went to Charwood, met with Tribunal, split into [[The Inheiritors/Lancaster\|Lancaster]] and [[Reese Locations/Charwood/Esriel\|Esriel]]

Wytherius was the one who powered the Wytherium Engine in Exellian Isles, and he communed with [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] whilst he was the Blessed Keviah. When Tytheradt disappeared, Wytherius decided it was time to leave, and then walked under the sea from Auril to Atilus, then Atilus to Reese.

"A long time ago, I may have been just a man. Its been so long I couldn't tell you, frankly. But this man, thought himself higher. I thought myself a god. And with this man, a woman stood with him, shoulder to shoulder. She was called Irina, and she believed.  Now, in Vatria, Gods are forged through the devotion and belief of their followers. Irina was wonderful for this. She spread my word throughout Auril, growing my church and my rule. Eventually, though, she grew ill. And I imparted upon her a most wonderful gift. I made her immortal, and then dragged her deep into the ocean with chains stretching from the heart of this world. She still floats, deep underwater, comatose, believing in *me.* Many more of my followers would succumb to the same fate. They remain there even now. Forever keeping me powerful and real. 

In time, my colony of devoted followers would grow large enough for my comfort. I truly descended to Vatria, and began to rule a kingdom in eastern Auril. Soon, I would find I was bound to Vatria, unable to return to my incorporeal godlike state. I sought a way to disable the weapon that was myself. I ruled that kingdom mercilessly, taking the most devoted of mine into my eternal embrace in the East Aurilian Sea. I called it the Apostle' Ridge - a ravine underwater stretching miles, filled with my followers, forever feeding me. When my kingdom began falling, and the chance of my capture and wielding by a former disciple of mine grew, I would descend into the ocean. 

I walked through the sea for years. Meeting with seedlings of civilizations and such. Charbok, your nation was one such seedling. I wish the best for your people, truly, I wish your father would've taken my offer when I gave it. But I carried onward to what is now called Reese. I found the resilient peoples of the Wrathcarved Mountains, and enlisted 9: 3 from 3 different, warring races. This became the Horizon Triumvirate, and they would extract my soul, and split it into two automatons. 

My first half would become Lancaster. An automaton which was encoded in lacking trust. Elqroque helped it in that front though. Lancaster would be made to bear the memories, but would need a catalyst to access them. Now, I have the catalyst, thank you again.

My second half would become Esriel. They were a gentle and perceptive automaton, who bore my instincts, abilities, and whatever else. They would be unable to meaningfully restrain themselves though, and in their hubris were killed on the frontier in 837 PM, Lancaster only got out with their pocket watch,

With Time's Muscle,  the core of Esriel, and this automaton we could reform the Triumvirate, or whatever yet remains. We could use their guidance, and reform him: Wytherius, the Drowned King, in me".

Drowned King was a ruler in east Auril. Gods are retained through the belief of their followers. The Drowned King would chain his followers to the ocean seabed in immortality, forever keeping his godhood. After descending to Vatria, ruled a kingdom in Auril, where he annointed himself with the title of the Drowned King. His name as a God was Wytherius. Soon, he would discover that he was bound to the corporeal world, and would seek a way to disable the weapon that was himself. After ruling mercilessly, the Drowned King would walk through the sea, meeting with the seeds of Atilus and doing x. Afterwards, he would seek out the resilient societies of the Wrathcarved Mountains. Enlisting 9 members from 3 races into a pact, the greatest minds would come together to extract Wytherius' soul, and permanently split him into two automatons, in a way that would prevent his powers from being used in a bad way. His first half would be Lancaster, a gruff, untrusting automaton, who would bear the memories of the Drowned King, but he would be unable to access them without a catalyst. The second would be Esriel, a gentle, perceptive automaton, who would bear the instincts, the abilities, and whatever else of the Drowned King, but they would be unable meaningfully restrain himself. Esriel would be killed in a duel before Reese was colonized, and their body stolen away. Lancaster would be crushed by this, and seek to crush all colonizers. Luckily, the core of Esriel was not destroyed, so if their body is to be recovered, through guidance of the remainders of the initial council who split him, Wytherius could be reformed in the body of Lancaster.

God of Water, Fate, and Time. Fate and Time in the way that water will erode whatever it rushes against.

The fall of his kingdom took place over 3 days. Once Tytheradt awoke, and Wytherius became aware of his motives. He then decided the kingdom must drown, and he must become unreachable.

On the first day, Wytherius marched upon the Ghoran Monastery. The Oracles were occupied at nearly all times communing between Wytherius and his people. He entered their sanctum, and slaughtered the 4 of them. He would enscribe their deaths on page of their skin, and bind their souls into a book of their own flesh - the Brachenihedronomicon. Their souls writhe as a amalgamation bound to the Oswald, granting wishes and knowledge through the book. Wytherius would frame their disappearance as a tragedy.

In light of their disappearance, he took control over the Highguard, killing their commander and posing as him. He commanded them to lay down Martial Law on the kingdom. The other battalions of Wytherius' men would begin taking up arms against the Highguard, starting a civil war. Wytherius' Generals would then march on Renlyamore Castle, intending to overthrow Wytherius for allowing such a war to happen. Wytherius was gone at this point, and the public saw this as a successful coup, and prayed to him in their desparation. 

At this point, Wytherius, fueled with this surge of power, would destroy Renlyamore Castle with his generals inside, and flood his kingdom with an unfathomable tsunami, sinking some of Auril, and dragging in all living citizens into the Apostles' Ridge.
