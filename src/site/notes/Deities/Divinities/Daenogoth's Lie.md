In 785 PM, Sil-Ahn was heading to Burbraic Theater to watch a children's school play centering around Sil-Ahn. Many of the town is there, as the largest school was putting on the production, and Sil-Ahn came in body, alongside his two Archpriests.

At the height of the play, Sil-Ahn was attacked by a cult - The Epitaph Manifest - to an imagined Devil. Sil-Ahn would try to cast a protection spell over the Theater to protect the civilians. The civilians would be forced back, and Sil-Ahn would be stuck inside, dying.

Sil-Ahn would succumb 1,111 days after this.

After killing Sil-Ahn in body, the spell would be dropped, and the High Guard of Burbraic would close in on the cult, charging them with Treason, Terrorism, Homicide, Deicide, Public Endangerment, and more, executing them in the Theater without trial. There, the theater would remain untouched, as a memorial to Sil-Ahn. The murderers corpses would rot there. The runes of Sil-Ahn's blood would remain.
