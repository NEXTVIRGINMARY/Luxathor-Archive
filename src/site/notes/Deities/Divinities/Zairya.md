333 Postmortem.
During [[The Martyrdom Syzygy\|The Martyrdom Syzygy]], the Kingdoms of Thyrelle were at war. The War of the Mutinous, it was called. As the three Kingdoms of Thyrelle grappled with their coming extinction, fighting for a place in the future, betrayals and backstabbing were rampant. From the High Kings to the lowest serf, not a soul was worthy of trust. From this bloodshed, the sky ripped open, dripping with the World's Gore. Falling like hail, came a beast. She would worsen this treachery tenfold. They called the beast ZAIRYA, and she would be their end.

Zairya is a mutilated, mask-wearing Devil that is currently bound to [[The Sewer Rats\|The Sewer Rats]]. She is also called The Reflection, The Mirror, Shadow, Smoke and Mirrors, or Lady Misfortune. She feeds on feelings of helplessness and failure.

She is in the shape of a human, but ruined. Her chest ripped open, exposing a glowing, beating heart and an empty ribcage, all laced with torn-up muscles and a dripping cardiovascular system. Her hanging skin drapes from her hip to her ankles, from her collarbone over her elbows, making a billowing dress out of her dermis. Her arms are scaled with how calloused the skin has become, and her fingers are webbed. From her ankles down, you see much the same situation, fingers and all.Â She has long hair, blowing in the wind, a clear, colourless bodily fluid causing strands to stick. Her face is covered with a porcelain mask. The faceplate is painted black, cracked around the eyes from age, revealing the white layer underneath. A horizontal line running right under her nose segments the mask, and across that line hangs small chains, glowing red with heat, all converging at her chin. At each of her temples hang short red ribbons, blowing and getting tangled in her hair. The top of the mask, right at her hairline, becomes an intricate tapestry of myth, a story of legend running from right to left, cresting with a 6 armed angel as a centerpiece. Behind this mask, her eyes are expressionless and black.

As seen in the Breathing Room, she has been continuously hurting the Heroes tangentially. She was the one who warned Shelton to stir up mistrust and paranoia, she led Kahn-Eir to sell out [[Deities/Empyreans/Lelki Coagulate\|Deities/Empyreans/Lelki Coagulate]] to Admiral Richtus, she played the part of [[PCs/Charbok Saullac\|Charbok Saullac]] in his home, making [[Atilus/Hebi\|Hebi]] believe his son had gone postal, has set up to tell [[Empress Aphelia Morne of House Grildvalke\|Aphelia]] about Black Ops Assignment: Hellfire, told [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]] how to disrupt DORO, told Tytheradt [[PCs/Keviah\|Keviah]] never felt anything to him.
