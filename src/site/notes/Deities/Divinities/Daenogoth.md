Daenogoth is a 5-armed demon that is currently bound to the Burbraic Theater. He is also referred to as "The One True Scream," "Misophobia,"  "Too Sharp I Cannot Dream," and "Amygdala."

In 771 PM, a Thri-Kreen was born, and named Hypochondriac Gorgonzilla in [[Reese Locations/Burbraic\|Burbraic]]. Burbraic was a large metropolis in Reese before the influence of outside nations, built in the Wrath Valley. Burbraic was predominantly populated by the Ahn-Lik (World-Builders) Thri-Kreen, who lived on the surface.

Hypochondriac was a typical Thri-Kreen child, but he had a knack for the supernatural. In the Mystics various excursions, they only came to Burbraic twice. Both times, Hypochondriac found himself afflicted and captivated. He would spend weeks investigating the area around their spawning, and why they appeared. Both times, Hypochondriac salvaged a bit of energy. On the first occasion, Hypochondriac would cause a surge of energy that would grow all the crops. On the second occasion, Hypochondriac killed 4 and leveled a house.

With the interest of the city, Hypochondriac was brought into the fold of the Burbraic government. Burbraic was a big enough city that they could generate a minor god: Sil-Ahn. Sil-Ahn, Sun of the Earth, was a Thri-Kreen who was chosen to ascend due to his high morality and his dedication to Burbraic. Sil-Ahn, understanding the magics of the world, took in Hypochondriac, and tried to guide his efforts. Hypochondriac Gorgonzilla would become a priest of Sil-Ahn, and would be everywhere with him.

Come 782 PM, Hypochondriac was turning 11. After studying under Sil-Ahn for 5 years, he began to come to an understanding. The council nominated a Thri-Kreen called Lukewarm Parmesan to martyr himself, and with his death the council would declare him a god. This godhood would unify the city under one banner, both politically and religiously. Unbeknownst to them, after 2 years of the entire metropolis praising his memory, he manifested as a minor god. Sil-Ahn, God of Light and Patron God of Burbraic came to form.

Hypochondriac decided that there must be an inversion. If the city could herald one mans memory enough, and he would gain magical properties, perhaps he could cause the city to hate him enough, and he would gain far greater power. 

In 785 PM, Sil-Ahn and Hypochondriac are heading to Burbraic Theater to watch a children's school play centering around Sil-Ahn. Many of the town is there, as the largest school was putting on the production, and Sil-Ahn came in body.

At the height of the play, Hypochondriac would drive a dagger into Sil-Ahn's back, and drag it down his body. Sil-Ahn, would try to cast a protection spell over the Theater, to protect the civilians. The civilians would be forced back, and Sil-Ahn would be stuck inside with Hypochondriac.

For 2 years, Hypochondriac tortured the immortal Sil-Ahn. Innocents and town guards would surround the amphitheater daily to try to break through Sil-Ahn's projected barricade and stop the madness, but no one could persevere. The entire city would be drowning in hatred towards Hypochondriac: he was the closest ally to Sil-Ahn, always together, as complimentary as the sun and moon. This hatred was potent, and it powered Hypochondriac. He eventually starved to death in this prison.

Mobs would form on the perimeter, as people itched for vengeance. Infighting would occur, as Burbraic's hatred towards Gorgonzilla would swell. That year, 787 PM, the harvest would be the lowest ever, due to consistently overcast days. Burbraic would mourn their God of Light, and the hatred would funnel in, and rebirth Hypochondriac. The hatred fueling him would begin his rebirth as a deity, and he would take the name Daenogoth. 

In 787, Burbraic would notice the rise of Daenogoth, and would try to combat it, but it would kill every soldier sent into the Theater. Daenogoth would then try to leave, to slaughter more, and find itself bound into the Theater by Sil-Ahn's immortal blood. Enraged, Daenogoth would begin manifesting. Over the next 9 days, no villager would sleep, as they were tormented by this demon. On the 9th day, a group would steal the holy artifacts from Sil-Ahn's days, and rush in. Daenogoth would slay all of them, and in their wake, Daenogoth would emerge, leveling Burbraic.

Daenogoth remains in Burbraic Theater, trapped by Sil-Ahn's immortal blood. Interlopers pass through, and it offers a bargain. In exchange for seeing through their eyes, he will give them access to some magic. The ossified eye it bestows upon them is really a seed for the plants of its soul, and upon their death, their skull will bloom. At the moment, Daenogoth is content using his vessels to gaze upon the land and inflict terror that way, and feels that Burbraic Theater is a safe enough place. If his name is said 3 times, he will summon whoever to his Inland Empire. His throne is the very moment the blast that leveled Burbraic went out, and the city began crumbling.

[[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|Serendipitous Chupacabra]] has taken his pact, and in a moment of pressure, took a mark.

His favorite sin is blossoming civilization.

When marked, if his Hated Chosen die before being fully marked, they blossom into the *Flacielia rigorium*, a plant grown in Daenogoth's hateful magic. Serendipitous possesses one such artifact.

Once fully marked, upon their death they will be consumed by Daenogoth, harbored as energy for hatred to feed him. Their bodies will grow slight *Flacielia rigorium*, and their husks will be used fully by Daenogoth, who will puppet them to farm more power. Alternatively, he will take a fully marked one to his great objective.

His goal is to harbor a Hated Chosen who will break the runes that Sil-Ahn's blood holds him by, and unleash him. Here, the Hated Chosen will ascend to The Ephialtes, and they will rule as supremely powerful individuals.

As of 28 Rthna 889, Daenogoth succeeded, as his Ephialtes began efforts to free him. The allies of the Ephialtes were resistant, though, and plunged into Daenogoth to attempt to destroy him.

Inside, he fed them lies upon lies. His first: Artex Nightfang. When the Heroes took the plunge, some of the Burbraic pensioners gained sentience. Artex was among them. Understanding what was happening, he recruited the dwarf to keep the party complacent.

After 7 days in the Inland Empire, and 35 days in reality, Daenogoth was killed.
