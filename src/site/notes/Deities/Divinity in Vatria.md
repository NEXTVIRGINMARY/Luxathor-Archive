While the two chief deities are the Unraveler and the Progenitor, they are more forces of nature than deities. Divinities are mortals who have garnered enough consistent tribute to ascend to another level of existence. God and Devils are mortal terms, there is no real difference between them other than perception. Some Divinities include: [[Deities/Divinities/Wytherius\|Wytherius]], Sil-Ahn, [[Deities/Divinities/Daenogoth\|Daenogoth]], and perhaps soon [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]], if he completes his objective.

To achieve divinity, four things must happen:
1. Sufficient tribute
	- You must have significant amounts of people worshipping you. Whatever method is up to you. Wytherius built a religion out of himself while king, and made his most devoted immortal and bound them to the seafloor, forever worshipping him. Sil-Ahn had a whole city giving tribute to his name. Daenogoth, with his tribute being hatred and negative emotion, had all of Bubraic captured in the second of their death, forever suffering. 
	- As your form acclimates to the flow of tribute, you must continue to find new ways to gather more. This is why divinities may forsake mortals and use them for tribute.
2. Death of the Self
	- To become a divinity, your mortal self must die. This is death of body and mind. With it, your name must also be buried. Wytherius was someone else, lost 300,000 years ago. Sil-Ahn was Lukewarm Parmesean. Daenogoth was Hypochondriac Gorgonzola.
	- This is done to filter out those with a lack of tribute and conviction. If you cannot push yourself to die, then you cannot wield godhood. If you cannot die and be risen by your name, then you do not deserve godhood. Additionally, it is also somewhat meta, as if you have good tribute chains, their mourning is like heroin to tithes.
	- Additionally, when you become a God, you embody your domain. I am the god of time, fate, and water. I embody the indifferent forever, the powerful stream, the racing clock. There is no room for who I once was in there.
3. Emotional Dismantling
	- To become a divinity, you will completely lose the capacity to feel emotion. You can use your previous emotional self as a lens to think about things through, but you will not feel. As time goes on, this memory becomes more and more distant, and the lens more and more opaque. Wytherius does not think you can ever fully lose it, but it becomes more a struggle than an alternative perspective. You don't miss it. 
	- Those with any form of suffering as their method of tithing do retain the ability, though. Why this is the case is anyone's guess.
	- This was done as a punishment from the Progenitor. As a Quintessential force made unable to act in too big a way, it did so to ensure anyone stealing the God mantle was not do so unnecessarily. 
4. Determinism of the Flock
	- When you take godhood, you are under the sway of those who follow you. When they imagine you as wrathful, slowly, without you ever realizing, you will become the most terribly vengeful, horrible god. They think you weep over the past, weep over them... by the heavens prepare to sob for all eternity. Whatever they see you as, for better or worse, you will become.
	- In my instance, I need not worry. It is one of the reasons I did what I did - killing my kingdom and chaining the followers to the Apostles' Ridge - I couldn't stand the lack of self-determination. If controlling the worthy's dreams, and destroying those I couldn't, didn't work, I would never have made it these thousands of years.


Gods, as an umbrella, in Vatria exist in three discrete categories:
1. **Divinities:** These are what most call "Gods," but really that term can apply to all of these. These are mortals that have undergone Ascension, fully sacrificing what is forced of them.
2. **Empyreans**: These are unknown to most, but would be recognized by any other name. These are the very stars in our night sky. Empyreans are powerful personifications of worldly mechanics. They are as broad as language to as specific as gunpowder. So long as they pour their own mechanics into this world and ensure their function, they will exist. They are much less invested in the world typically, staying high in the heavens, but each is capable of anointing a Champion to enforce their will. Some Empyreans you all have encountered have been the Lelki Coagulate and The Ferryman.
3. **Quintessence**: The very founders of this earth, Quintessence are known by all. The Progenitor and the Unraveler. Maker and Destroyer.
