The Ceaseless Watcher is a Voyeuristic Idol of sin from Othohan, before the Cataclysm, that feeds on witnessing sin. An effigy of it sits on the gates of the [[Reese Locations/Mnemonic Abyss & The Mortal Forge\|Mnemonic Abyss & The Mortal Forge]]. When questioned about it, [[Deities/Daenogoth\|Daenogoth]] told Serendipitous about it.
