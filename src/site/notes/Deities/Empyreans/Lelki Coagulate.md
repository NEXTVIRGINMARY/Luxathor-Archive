The Lelki Coagulate is an Aberrant Empyrean - one that has escaped their normal hanging from the stars.

The Lelki Coagulate is mass of psionic goop found at the bottom of Brauk-Her-Ahn, in the temple called Fa. She is responsible for the creating of the Thri-Kreen people. Occasionally, she anoints her Chosen to serve as a Hand for her power. Recently, these two have been [[The Inheiritors/Noel Chupacabra\|Noel Chupacabra]] and [[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|Serendipitous Chupacabra]].

The Lelki Coagulate is unique as an Aberrant Empyrean. There are a few in the world, but She is unique in her approach and her power. The true bounds of how this is so is unknown.

The Lelki Coagulate is the genius loci of the Thri-Kreen. She is a large mass, deep in the heart of Brauk-Her-Ahn: Fa. She created the Thri-Kreen, molding them into their current shape, and then began choosing Champions, who then served her will around Corinthous. Some chosen include Serendipitous Chupacabra, Noel Chupacabra, and Sil-Ahn.
