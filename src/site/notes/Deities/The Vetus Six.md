The Vetus Six are six Gods, worshipped by the Prophesized, who retained power through the Cataclysm even through the lack of faith. Perhaps they are something greater than modern [[Divinity in Vatria\|Deities]], given their overlap with the Quintessential Pair. 

The Vetus Six consisted of the following:
- Uiy - God of Memory
- Anzer - God of War
- Esu - God of Parable
- Dicp - God of Recreation
- Nissr - God of the Dying
- Qreuit'r - God of Artistry
