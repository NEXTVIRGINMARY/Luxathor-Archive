**The Basics**
- Name of the Country: The Regency Crown
- Complete Name: Isles of the Dahlic Crown
- Ideology: No such universal ideology, although the Regent's Creed is well understood by most
	Aeotalists follow the Universal Myth, praying to and serving The Progenitor, and are the majority of the population.
	Regent's Creed: After the stillbirth of the New King, (called the Divine Delay,) Reiser Jouen was made King, called the Regent King. It is now tradition for the King to have a bastard, and for that child to become the Regent King. 
- Government: Ruled by a Regent King, until his bastard grows to 21 or kills him.
	The Regent King is meant to maintain peace, order, and a righteous society to make a society fit to welcome the New King. The Regency Crown is a police state, meant on keeping the lower class working on production of large fleets, the middle class looking down on the lower class as police, and the upper class indulging in opulence and diplomacy
