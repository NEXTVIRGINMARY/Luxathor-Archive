**The Basics**
- Name of the Country: The Zenithene Empire
- Complete Name: Sovereign Empire of the Zenithene Adherents of the Progenitor
- Ideology: Aeotalists
	Aeotalists follow the Universal Myth, praying to and serving The Progenitor
- Government: Ruled by a single Emperor, chosen from one of The Nine Houses. 
	The Emperor is chosen through an election every 15 years, where all Nine Houses elect one Candidate to be sent into an Academy in the Emperor's Peak. The best of these Candidates duel the Emperor, and the winner is the next Emperor.
		The Nine Houses are industry leaders, prominent figures, etc. who have won a Medallion, marking them as a new House, thus removing the old. 

**Geography**
- Capital: The Apex
	The Apex is located on the Author's Peninsula, built around The Wound.
- Major Cities: The Apex, Lateria, Duelian (By Extension)
- Major Regions: The Author's Peninsula, Neinwald Cliffs, Thon'sahd Bay
- Location: Herria
	Herria is the continent the Zenithene is located on and is currently expanding across. Named after Kyynren Herria, The First Emperor, and Paragon Adherent of the Progenitor. He was the First Emperor, and was one of the major players of the Aeotalist Church in the early days. His teachings are still some of the most prominent, despite the Millenia since his death.
		The Main 3 players in the early days of the Aeotalist Church were Kyynren Herria, Tyol Neinwald, and Lucan Thon'sahd.
		-  Herria was a human priest and politican, who coined the term "Zenithene" for the followers of the Aeotalist. This stuck until his 3rd year as Emperor (18 PM), which he then named the nation and its citizens were now the Zenithene, and followers of the Church were Aeotalists.
		- Tyol Neinwald was a human priest of the Aeotalist Church. He served as a interpreter of the Universal Myth, and would author the holy text: The Oswald's Parable. Neinwald's interpretation of the Cataclysm and the Myth would lead to the Universally Adopted Calendar of Vatria, lesser known as Tyolan Standard. 
		- Lucan Thon'sahd was an Eladrin of a tribe that emerged near The Wound  immediately after the Cataclysm. Thon'sahd was a priest of the church but was primarily a politician who attempted to sway the Zenithene from an Empire into a Theocratic Monarchy, under the rule of Einri Bon-Suahd, the chieftan of the Eladrin tribe who claimed to be an extension of the Progenitor's holy will. The other two could not keep Thon'sahd from interfering in their attempted political and religious takeover, so they integrated him in their plans and wrote history so that he would seem a collaborator rather than a staunch advocate against them. He officially was an advisor during the first term of Herria, and was killed on the first year of Herria's second term, reason cited as "Sudden Collapse and Death"
		Lucan's tribe would be enslaved and then used as unwilling blood donors for powerful families to infuse their bloodline with "The Progenitor's Grace."
		Such bloodlines held latent power and are still active today, some examples being the Herrias, the Neinwalds, the Grildvalkes, and the Dahlics. The Regent Kings still claim this power (Regardless of name or how diluted it is)

**Population**
- Estimated over 4 Million over all of Herria as of 850 PM. 
- Dense in The Apex and the Author's Peninsula, fairly rural everywhere else save for Thon'sahd Bay.
- 1% in Upper Class, 15% in Middle Class, 68% in Lower Class, 7% enslaved, 9% in Military

**Religion - Unitalists**
- Aeotalist Church formed by Kyynren Herria, Tyol Nienwald, and Lucan Thon'sahd, along with some other nobles.
- Aeotalist Church is the standard for the Zenithene, those not a part of it are not shunned but not encouraged.
- Aeotalism encourages: 1. Servitude of the Progenitor, both through The Oswald's Parable and through its divine host in the Emperor. 2. A recognizing of the Aeotal Principle: that we are all of the Progenitor, and all should be made to understand that by their end. 3. A recognizing of the fact that those who do not serve the Progenitor are merely tools to extend it's will, and even some who do serve the Progenitor were only in place to act as an extension of its will.
- The hierarchy of the church is the Emperor, then the Aeotyolan Heart, then the Weavers, then Thriests, then the masses.
- The Oswald's Parable describes the Progenitor's holy creation and process through its Five Chapters from the point of view of The Oswald, a mass of consciousness that is now the Universal Unconscious because we are currently using all of it.
	- They do refer to the Universal Unconscious as The Oswald, still.
	- The Oswald's Parable is as follows
		1. The Grindstone: the continuous happenings of the Progenitor and the Unraveler. The Oswald would come to know life in every tapestry, until the Unraveler would begin sowing chaos and the Oswald would return to its previous state of unbeing. The end of this chapter tells of a terrible rage of the Progenitor, that ends the world as much as the Unraveler does.
		2. The Exele: Chapter 2 would tell of the weaving of Exellia, the Unraveler's trapping and the first witnessed millennium by the Oswald. Warns of the Exellia sinners will find themselves in, and now serves as fuel to prejudice against Exellians.
		3. The Spinning: Chapter 3 tells of the toils of weaving the magnum opus of Vatria. Without needing to circumvent its twin, it found itself creating terrible terrain meant to obstruct its efforts for no purpose. An infinity of doing this with muscle memory, the Progenitor would learn both the purpose of an enemy and the ability to care for and protect that it loves.
		4. The Promised: Chapter 4 tells of the Oswald becoming the Prophesized, and serving the Progenitor and basking in its gift. This chapter shows the importance of kneeling to those above you, the importance of understanding that everything is a tool given to you by the Progenitor, and that enough deviance will result in punishment.
		5. The Cataclysm: Chapter 5 expands on the punishment told of in the last chapter, with enough Prophesized sinning that the Unraveler's final scheme could unravel, pun not intended. The Unraveler would unleash the Primordials who would terrorize the Prophesized for centuries, until the Unraveler formed in Vatria. This chapter emphasizes the absolute incomprehensible horror of the Unraveler, and gives credence to the Progenitor being a savior. As the Cataclysm unfolds, and the Progenitor forms, the Oswald is desperate to withdraw into itself. It is unable, as one Prophesized has taken cover from this duel of Twin Gods and lives in an eternal hellscape. The Oswald suffers as this Prophesized struggles to live, tortured by terrors. It finds itself buried alive in sentient ground that only just keeps it alive, it falls forever as the land and oceans shift and scream at the duel, it succumbs to a terrible prelude of Reeserot of a twisted fungus that burrows its tentacles into its skin. Then, the final day, brutalized and on the brink, this Prophesized, and by extension the Oswald, witnesses the Progenitor unweave reality from inside, before the Unraveler makes a killing strike. The Progenitor retaliates, and absorbs the Unraveler into itself and dies. Watching these gods merge and die, and Vatria begin to settle as the Wound forms, the Prophesized kills itself using a glassy obsidian shard. 
		6. Epilogue: The Oswald is free from Vatria once the final life form dies by suicide. It returns to where the Progenitor would weave its tapestries, and see nothing. Here, the Oswald remains, far from humanity. It gives us itself for consciousness, but is terribly scarred by the Cataclysm. It has done what it can to keep the memories from us, but they will leak, and The Oswald hopes that someone capable can transcribe its history into a text for all the worthy and righteous to understand.
