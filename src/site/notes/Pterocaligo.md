**Also known as: Gloomflyer**

The Pterocaligo, more commonly referred to as a Gloomflyer, is one of many living memories that haunts the Mnemonic Abyss. It resembles a dragon, swathed in shadow - but, parts of it are just... wrong. Spines along its wings seem to bend into themselves. Its teeth are too big for its mouth. The shadows that bleed off of it seem to be physical. 

[[Some Characters/Drěndïr\|Drěndïr]] has her own Pterocaligo, specifically linked to her. Its shadow is eternally burning off. This Pterocaligo was the one who initially knocked her into the [[Reese Locations/Mnemonic Abyss & The Mortal Forge\|Mnemonic Abyss & The Mortal Forge]]
