Hebi is the current King of Atilus. He is the husband to Kaa; father of [[PCs/Charbok Saullac\|Charbok Saullac]], Naloth, Jax, Kira, Bindi, Minerva, and the artist formally known as [[Atilus/Cicero\|Cicero]]. 

It is by his misunderstanding that the current slave trade to the [[Country Profiles/The Zenithene Empire\|The Zenithene Empire]] occurs. His father, Baipa, struck a deal during the Martyrdom Syzygy. Hebi ran off this precedent, and his misunderstanding has cost the lives of many Serpents. Hebi met with [[Deities/Divinities/The Drowned King\|The Drowned King]] in the past, turning down an offering for a cure to his sins.
