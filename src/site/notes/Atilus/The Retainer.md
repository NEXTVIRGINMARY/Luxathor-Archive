The Retainer is the son of [[Atilus/Hebi\|Hebi]], and brother to [[PCs/Charbok Saullac\|Charbok Saullac]]. In the year 787, the son is sold into Zenithene Slavery. He was possessed by the Emperor for 3 years, eventually acquired by [[Tytheradt\|Thyra Will]], the Ten-Year Emperor, thought to be dead. 

Once Tytheradt acquired it, he would begin The Retainer's transformation. Since Tytheradt had yet to get a phylactery, and he knew that Serpents reincarnate into Dragonborn, he would groom The Retainer into his Living Phylactery. The Retainer would be robbed of its identity and sense of self, now embodying Tytheradt's phylactery. If Tytheradt were to die, The Retainer would die instead, and Tytheradt would reincarnate into its body.
