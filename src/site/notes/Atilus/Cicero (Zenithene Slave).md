A slave sold to the Zenithene Empire by [[Atilus/Hebi\|Hebi]]'s Pact. Cicero was close friends with [[Atilus/The Retainer\|The Retainer]]. Cicero did not know his own name, and took the name Cicero. The Retainer made friends with him quickly, as he was distressed, and despite Cicero not knowing who he is, he took in the Retainer.

The Retainer credits Cicero as the reason why he held onto the past, as Cicero showed him what life could've been had he not been discarded from Atilus. It is from Cicero there is just enough emotion in him to restore The Retainer's individuality.

The Retainer takes the name Cicero as a way to honor his old friend once he is freed.
