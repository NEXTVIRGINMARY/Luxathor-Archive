Cicero is the son of [[Atilus/Hebi\|Hebi]], and brother to [[PCs/Charbok Saullac\|Charbok Saullac]]. In the year 787, the son is sold into Zenithene Slavery. He was possessed by the Emperor for 3 years, eventually acquired by [[Tytheradt\|Thyra Will]], the Ten-Year Emperor, thought to be dead. 

Once Tytheradt acquired him, he would begin The Retainer's transformation. Since Tytheradt had yet to get a phylactery, he would groom The Retainer into his Living Phylactery. The Retainer would be robbed of its identity and sense of self, now embodying Tytheradt's phylactery. If Tytheradt were to die, The Retainer would die instead, and Tytheradt would reincarnate into its body. 

During his time in Herria, he would meet [[Atilus/Cicero (Zenithene)\|Cicero]], who would show him the value of life even in strife. Once freed, The Retainer would take his friends name as a sign of respect, thanks, and memorial.

Now, as Cicero, he has the potential to be a free man. However, he feels he is bound to Reese, meant to pay off the misdeeds he did while under the spell of the FMC. He is an advanced intelligence officer in [[The Inheiritors/The Inheritors (Group)\|The Inheritors (Group)]], working with Wytherius to magically gather and distribute information. He also assists the Heroes, using his Sepulchre to allow them respite and a dedicated workplace from anywhere. In Rhodes, he is honored as a hero, and works as a Deputy Commander in the Reese Militia.
