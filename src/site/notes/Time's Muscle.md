The remains of [[Deities/The Drowned King\|Wytherius]]'s power in [[Reese Locations/Charwood/Esriel\|Esriel]]. After their death at [[Tytheradt\|Tytheradt]]'s hands, their core was made into "A Heart of the Traitorous God". This core would be the key to an experimental village, south of Duelian. The Cosgrove was a town with a population of 164, until Tytheradt used Times Muscle and the Wytherium Engine to shroud it in a magical veil on its own demiplane, where its subjects would be forced to undergo magical experiment, with the village resetting at sunrise.
