Balor Wren is a serpent found lurking around Reese. It is 23 foot long, 8 without the tail, serpent with scales blacker than night, with sparks that live and die out like stars. It has large black eyes, with single white dots as pupils. Balor Wren wears a black cloak that seems to hold galaxies in its underside. It is not an Atilan.

Balor Wren serves as a reaper-like figure. When Serpents die, it collects their disgraced souls and weaves them into a mass found inside the First Serpent Kingdom, Phaia Nacq. This is the Choir, a massive entity of hands that is the collective conscious for all the dead Atilans. As the Choirkeeper, Balor Wren prunes and grows the Choir like a dear plant, awaiting the day its wisdom may be passed on. 

After it witnessed the endless ebb and flow of the Serpent kings, and drawing understanding from the leaves of its Choir, the Balor would create its hypothesis. From the voices of its Choir, and its own ideas, Balor Wren postulated that any attempts for an Atilan Kingdom were doomed for failure. Other kingdoms were already doomed: the Zenithene Empire struggled due to the rapid change of Emperor, compounded atop a lack of vision, and the Regency Crown struggles due to the fact that the Regent King will never fully be seen as legitimate, and any ruler will be forever waiting for an ancient stillborn child to suddenly come to life. Serpent kingdoms are not held back by prior circumstance and history, but they still fail. Balor Wren deems this a problem of corruption and expectation. They struggle because during their vast lives, they constantly try to bolster themselves and their kingdoms, always at a cost of their people. While it doesn't have to be universal, it has been. 

The Balor wishes to break this trend.

Those who heed his warning will be gifted the Nagakin Crown, its gift to the first king, who then cast his people into ruin.
