Born in 860 PM, Anastasia Chupacabra was an Ahn-Lik Thri-Kreen. Raised in the wake of the First Offensive, she would use her youth as cover for sabotage, making strikes at the incoming FMC as she could. Her family would eventually cut her loose, as one of her little acts of revolution led to a death sentence on her head. 

She would not serve this sentence. Ever.

Slipping away and into obscurity, without family or fears, she honed her nomadic abilities, being able to survive in the cruel deserts of Reese. She quickly took a reputation as a mirage-like phantom, a woman who would move through the desert like swinging on vines through a jungle. In this time, she taught herself to treat Reeserot, to kill at ranges unheard of, to tame the most feral of beasts. 

As she settled into this new persona, the Offensives would carry on, pushing out her wilds, and ushering in a tamed frontier. After the Farmer's Insurrection, she would come across [[The Inheiritors/Noel Chupacabra\|Noel Chupacabra]], falling in love. Here, she was happy to settle out of interloping, and into domesticity for a time, with a love and a child. Once her son hatched, her priorities would follow her husbands. 

Noel would enter into the FMC, and she would promise to maintain the bonds forged in the Farmer's Insurrection. Much of her skills with people would be form in this time, spinning a web. Simultaneously, she was able to relax, and grow healthy once again in her home, [[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|spinning a different kind of web]].

Following this, she would use her newfound lust for life to foster life. After establishing [[The Inheiritors/The Inheiritors (Group)\|a clandestine cell network]] and handing it to Noel, she would work as a teacher in the local town of [[Reese Locations/Rhodes\|Rhodes]], raising the next generation outside of the flag of the FMC. In her free time, when needed, she would work as a field medic for revolutionary acts, treating the current generation so they may keep burning the flag of the FMC.

This life - a cycle of family, education, medicine - would not last forever. Soon, her husband would be gone. He disappeared. [[FMC Operatives/Bor, Hand of the FMC\|Bor, Hand of the FMC]], would make his claims fact: Noel Chupacabra had fallen off a cliff. 

Noel Chupacabra is dead. 

Once again, she was alone. 

Her life would fly by here, as she withdraw from everything. She would rot as she waited for him to return, leaving her son to his own devices. All would be abandoned, until she had a realization. If the Inheritors were still running, this wasn't an accident. It was a murder. 

A failsafe was put in place, she was sure. No longer was [[The Inheiritors/The Progenitor (Inheiritor)\|The Progenitor]] organizing it all. Surely if it was an accident, they would make the mantle the same. No. This was different. Her husband had been killed by the FMC.

Her lust for life would return, changed. A lust for something long gone, and at the same time, a lust for revenge. She knew she had already failed her son, so she left. She began to withdraw, and took up spinning a web yet again. In the North Wrathcarved, a group of revolutionaires calling themselves [[Samus L'ebarge\|The Apollodorans]] had been a presence for a while. They were a group built on the desire to return to the way of Corinthian life - Reese before it was called Reese.  She would tap into them, and help their leadership mold into the Ravagers.

She knew her time was running out. She couldn't be here forever, especially when the FMC had a new dispatch that had tech built to counteract her. Their disposal swords, sharp as razors, cut through any beast she would be able to ride, and their hip-mounted grappling system allowed them overwhelmingly exceptional movement, only increased by their lateral thrusts with gas. She knew of Noel's triumph: his being Chosen. Perhaps...

She began to set a plan into motion. Her son would be the embodiment of the Inheritor. First, she would design relics in the image of their [[The Lelki Coagulate\|Mother]], imbued with ancient magic of the early Ahn-Kiin hives. They were named Fushigi. 7 of them would be scattered across their land. Anastasia made them so that when they would be gathered, they would create a formation meant to invoke [[Reese Locations/Duelian\|Duelian]], highlighting Brauk-Her-Ahn. 

She would then descend into their ancestral hive. Duelian had already begun their efforts downward, but that would prove no trouble to The Mirage. She entered Brauk-Io, and moved through its streets into its heart. In front of its council, she would petition for [[PCs/Serendipitous Chupacabra\|The Inheritor]], demanding his potential be recognized, respected, and written. They would give into her threats and orders, and when the One She Spoke of entered, he would be [[The Lelki Coagulate\|ushered to Fa.]]

After some time building up more alliances and revolutionary groups, something whispered a revelation in her ear. Her Noel was alive. Infected by Reeserot and held captive by the FMC, yes, but alive. 

It was time for her most drastic measure yet. Her son was out there somewhere, and his father was dying. If everything went as she would desire, her son - The Inheritor - would be the one to save him. She had been faced with the FMC elite, and she had almost been faced with death. If someone was to save Noel, it would be him. She would have to give him a window.

In her final day, she returned to the Chupacabra homestead. She desired to leave a note and a gift to her son before departing, but upon her arrival, she found the ranch damaged, the sands bloody. Inside, there was a serpent and a reborn, alongside her son. She would move through the house stealthily, give her son a kiss on the forehead, and depart. She mounted her bulette, Ghraakka, and would ride south.

During her travels, she had become no stranger to the Terrorous Reaches. She knew what lay at the bottom. She knew what spread the Rot. She would enter Town, making her way into Juyiul, all like a ghost. She moved past Auphreite like they had never known she was there. She reached the Chalice, laid her hands around its base...

She drank deep.

As the Rot spilled into her, the body of Anastasia Chupacabra rapidly decayed, becoming a gathering of nondescript bile. For all her resistance, it overtook her like a flood taking cars. 

And thus, Anastasia was no more.

[[The Grey Mistress\|Until she was.]]

Her conscious would awake in the vestiges of Rot, feeling it teeming through her, using her as a conduit to further its mutation and evolution. She would stay this way for what felt like an eternity - until her mission came back to her. They were relying on her. Noel was still in there and the door was not yet open. What Once Was Anastasia Chupacabra fought back, and her willpower carved a space out for her.

She was Something Else, now. Something higher. As her mind and will fought for her, she slowly become something new. Inside her was a whole separate conscious. She and Her had become one. Anastasia Chupacabra had become The Grey Mistress, the Empyrean of Rot. 

As the Mistress tended to its agenda, it would cry out. Its Champion: Auphreite, Conduit of Rot - slaughtered! The Mistress let pour more Rot, flooding Juyiul, but stopped itself. Three figures stood over their corpse. The Mistress knew she musn't trifle. A part of her was not going to let the Killers be destroyed by her force. 

As it waited, it understood the urgency to anoint a new Champion. Its Rot was already receding, and it was losing its place among the stars. She would choose someone close to the Killers, to keep its anchor near them. [[Orrous Morton\|Orrous Morton]], a promising aspirant who was already infected and had already communed with it, was the perfect choice. 

It communed with him, anointing him Conduit, and giving him one singular order: touch the sky, and let Rot spill in forevermore. While she wasn't wholly satisfied with this, it would be the best task she could give, in hopes they would come to slay the Conduit once again...
